            "abstract": "In today\u201es world, every tiny gadget is a potential data source, adding to the huge data bank. Every day, we create 2.5 quintillion bytes of data \u2013 structured and unstructured, so much that 90% of the data in the world today has been created in the last two years alone. This data generated through large customer transactions, social networking sites is varied, voluminous and rapidly generating. All this data prove a storage and processing crisis for the enterprises. While more data enables realistic analysis and thus help in making accurate business decisions / goals, it is equally difficult to manage and analyze such a huge amount of data. This document provides insights on the challenges of managing such a huge Data \u2013 popularly known as Big Data, the solutions offered by Big Data management tools/ techniques and the opportunities it has created.

            "abstract": "Today, big data are generated from many sources, and there is a huge demand for storing, managing, processing, and querying on big data. The MapReduce model and its counterpart open source implementation Hadoop, has proven itself as the de facto solution to big data processing, and is inherently designed for batch and high throughput processing jobs. Although Hadoop is very suitable for batch jobs, there is an increasing demand for non-batch requirements like: interactive jobs, real-time queries, and big data streams. Since Hadoop is not suitable for these non-batch workloads, new solutions are proposed to these new challenges. In this article, we discussed two categories of these solutions: real-time processing, and stream processing of big data. For each category, we discussed paradigms, strengths and differences to Hadoop. We also introduced some practical systems and frameworks for each category. Finally, some simple experiments were performed to approve effectiveness of new solutions compared to available Hadoop-based solutions.",

            "abstract": "The proliferation of GPS-enabled mobile devices has generated geo-tagged data at an unprecedented rate over the past decade. Data-processing systems that aim to ingest, store, index, and analyze Big Data must deal with such geo-tagged data efficiently. In this paper, among representative, disk-resident spatial indexing methods that have been adopted by major SQL and NoSQL systems, we implement five variants of these methods in the form of Log-Structured Merge-tree-based (LSM) spatial indexes in order to evaluate their pros and cons for dynamic geo-tagged Big Data. We have implemented the alternatives, including LSM-based B-tree, R-tree, and inverted index variants, in Apache AsterixDB, an open source Big Data management system. This implementation enabled comparison in terms of real end-to-end performance, including logging and locking overheads, in a full-function, query-based system setting. Our evaluation includes both static and dynamic workloads, ranging from a \"load once, query many\" case to a case where continuous concurrent incremental inserts are mixed with concurrent queries. Based on the results, we discuss the pros and cons of the five index variants.",

            "abstract": "\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this paper is to explore the effect of big data analytics-capable business process management systems (BDA-capable BPMS) on ambidextrous organizations\u2019 agility. In particular, how the functionalities of BDA-capable BPMS may improve organizational dynamism and reactiveness to challenges of Big Data era will be explored.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nA theoretical analysis of the potential of BDA-capable BPMS in increasing organizational agility, with particular attention to the ambidextrous organizations, has been performed. A conceptual framework was subsequently developed. Next, the proposed conceptual framework was applied in a real-world context.\n\n\nFindings\nThe research proposes a framework highlighting the importance of BDA-capable BPMS in increasing ambidextrous organizations\u2019 agility. Moreover, the authors apply the framework to the cases of consumer-goods companies that have included BDA in their processes management.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThe principal limitations are linked to the need to validate quantitatively the proposed framework.\n\n\nPractical implications\nThe value of the proposed framework is related to its potential in helping managers to fully understand and exploit the potentiality of BDA-capable BPMS. Moreover, the implications show some guidelines to ease the implementation of such systems within ambidextrous organizations.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe research offers a model to interpret the effects of BDA-capable BPMS on ambidextrous organizations\u2019 agility. In this way, the research addresses a significant gap by exploring the importance of information systems for ambidextrous organizations\u2019 agility.\n",

            "abstract": "Cloud storage is bell used by all the community in recent years since it provides various benefits over the traditional storage. Cloud storage Elves many benefits to users, but at the same time, many security problems arise in cloud storage which prevents organizations to migrate their data to cloud storage. The huge amount of data are available in the current Internet period, people who want to search,for information about a particular topic, are very much shocked because it has become very difficult for them to move around the web page and search the exact information. This implies that decisions are being taken on the basis of incomplete and poor understanding by organizations. Most of the search engines which are being used today by user completely rely on keywords matching. Due to this, a user receives a huge volume of inappropriate data after spending maximum time in browsing the results. Sometimes more complicated queries are framed to improve the search output. To overcome this constraint, researchers are working on the new technique called semantic-based solution. Also at times, it seems that the information stored in these clouds work on a plan that is not understandable by all. This big data that is stored in these clouds get processed automatically before they are even presented to the users. In this paper, a general algorithm is being proposed that implements a semantic search engine in the cloud database that uses semantic technologies to extract the relevant data for the user. We also would like to explain the working of the semantic searching with the correlation of the Big Data and the processing it goes through.",

            "abstract": "PurposeThis paper aims to investigate the use of big data (BDU) in predicting technological innovation, supply chain and SMEs' performance and whether technological innovation mediates the association between BDU and firm performance. Additionally, this research also seeks to explore the moderating effect of information sharing in the association between BDU and technological innovation.Design/methodology/approachUsing survey methods and structural associations in AMOS 24.0., the proposed model was tested on SME managers recruited from the largest economic and manufacturing hub of China, Pearl River Delta.FindingsThe findings suggest that BDU is positively related to technological innovation (product and process) and organizational outcomes (e.g., supply chain and SMEs performance). Technological innovation (i.e., product and process) significantly mediates the association between BDU and organizational outcomes. Moreover, information sharing positively moderates the association between BDU and technological innovations.Practical implicationsThis research provides deeper insights into how BDU is useful for SME managers in achieving the firm\u2019s goals. Particularly, SME managers can bring technological innovation into their business processes, overcome the challenges of forecasting, and generate dynamic capabilities for attaining the best SMEs\u2019 performance. Additionally, BDU with information sharing enables SMEs reduce their risk and decrease production costs in their manufacturing process.Originality/valueFirms always need to adopt new ways to enhance their productivity using available resources. This is the first study that contributes to big data and performance management literature by exploring the moderating and mediation mechanism of information sharing and technological innovation respectively using RBVT. The study and research model enhances our insights on BDU, information sharing, and technological innovation as valuable resources for organizations to improve supply chain performance, which subsequently increases SME productivity. This gap was overlooked by previous researchers in the domain of big data.",

            "abstract": "In recent years there has been a growing interest in developing \"streaming algorithms\" for efficient processing and querying of continuous data streams. These algorithms seek to provide accurate results while minimizing the required storage and the processing time, at the price of a small inaccuracy in their output. A fundamental query of interest is the intersection size of two big data streams. This problem arises in many different application areas, such as network monitoring, database systems, data integration and information retrieval. In this paper we develop a new algorithm for this problem, based on the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method. We show that this algorithm outperforms all known schemes in terms of the estimation's quality (lower variance) and that it asymptotically achieves the optimal variance.",

            "abstract": "Mineral resources are are non-renewable precious resources and one of the basic sources of human production and life. At present, the daily work of the mineral management department involves the production of a large number of reports, maps, official document receiving and sending, transmission, examination and approval, query statistics and other work. Due to the low efficiency of data collection, analysis and supervision in all aspects of the life cycle of mining rights, the real-time supervision and management of the exploration, mining, reserves change and development and utilization of mining rights cannot be realized by the mineral regulatory authorities, so it is urgent to build an efficient mineral resource management system to meet the above challenges. This paper mainly studies the design process system of mineral resource management system based on big data technology and GIS technology, which integrates big data technology and GIS technology, covering the functions of mining right management, exploration right management, GIS map management, geological exploration management, resource reserve management, achievement resource database management, data statistical analysis management, etc. The system makes full use of the spatial analysis advantages of GIS system. The government\u2019s mineral supervision department can effectively realize the real-time supervision of the development and utilization of mineral resources. It can also improve the refined production management ability of mineral enterprises under the current mining situation and the adaptability to market changes, and help the industrial upgrading and business model innovation of mineral enterprises.",

            "abstract": "As more and more companies are embracing Big data, it has become apparent that the ultimate challenge is to relate massive amounts of event data to processes that are highly dynamic. To unleash the value of event data, events need to be tightly connected to the control and management of operational processes. However, the primary focus of Big data technologies is currently on storage, processing, and rather simple analytical tasks. Big data initiatives rarely focus on the improvement of end-to-end processes. To address this mismatch, we advocate a better integration of data science, data technology and process science. Data science approaches tend to be process agonistic whereas process science approaches tend to be model-driven without considering the \u201cevidence\u201d hidden in the data. Process mining aims to bridge this gap. This editorial discusses the interplay between data science and process science and relates process mining to Big data technologies, service orientation, and cloud computing.",

            "abstract": "PurposeThis paper aims to examine how the extant publication has related big data analytics (BDA) to supply chain planning (SCP). The paper presents a conceptual model based on the reviewed articles and the dominant research gaps and outlines the research directions for future advancement.Design/methodology/approachBased on a systematic literature review, this study analysed 72 journal articles and reported the descriptive and thematic analysis in assessing the established body of knowledge.FindingsThis study reveals the fact that literature on relating BDA to SCP has an ambiguous use of BDA-related terminologies and a siloed view on SCP processes that primarily focuses on the short-term. Looking at the big data sources, the objective of adopting BDA and changes to SCP, we identified three roles of big data and BDA for SCP: supportive facilitator, source of empowerment and game-changer. It bridges the conversation between BDA technology for SCP and its management issues in organisations and supply chains according to the technology-organisation-environmental framework.Research limitations/implicationsThis paper presents a comprehensive examination of existing literature on relating BDA to SCP. The resulted themes and research opportunities will help to advance the understanding of how BDA will reshape the future of SCP and how to manage BDA adoption towards a big data-driven SCP.Originality/valueThis study is unique in its discussion on how BDA will reshape SCP integrating the technical and managerial perspectives, which have not been discussed to date.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, precision agriculture is becoming very popular. The introduction of modern information and communication technologies for collecting and processing Agricultural data revolutionise the agriculture practises. This has started a while ago (early 20th century) and it is driven by the low cost of collecting data about everything; from information on fields such as seed, soil, fertiliser, pest, to weather data, drones and satellites images. Specially, the agricultural data mining today is considered as Big Data application in terms of volume, variety, velocity and veracity. Hence it leads to challenges in processing vast amounts of complex and diverse information to extract useful knowledge for the farmer, agronomist, and other businesses. It is a key foundation to establishing a crop intelligence platform, which will enable efficient resource management and high quality agronomy decision making and recommendations. In this paper, we designed and implemented a continental level agricultural data warehouse (ADW). ADW is characterised by its (1) flexible schema; (2) data integration from real agricultural multi datasets; (3) data science and business intelligent support; (4) high performance; (5) high storage; (6) security; (7) governance and monitoring; (8) consistency, availability and partition tolerant; (9) cloud compatibility. We also evaluate the performance of ADW and present some complex queries to extract and return necessary knowledge about crop management.",

How can employee privacy be protected in the age of datafication? This article surveys the potential and shortcomings of a number of legal and technical solutions to show the advantages of human rights-based approaches in addressing corporate responsibility to respect privacy and strengthen human agency. Based on this notion, we develop a process-oriented model of Privacy Due Diligence to complement existing frameworks for safeguarding employee privacy in an era of Big Data surveillance.",

            "title": "The Data Revolution. Big Data, Open Data, Data Infrastructures and Their Consequences",
            "abstract": "The last few years have witnessed an increasing production of data that have become open, accessible and available at low cost. Although many disciplines are already using \u2018big data\u2019 as instrument of analysis, social sciences have apparently missed the opportunity to exploit their potentialities fully. The purpose of this excellent book is to prove how these data do not exist independently from the ideas, techniques, technologies, people and context that produce, process, manage, analyze and store them. Moreover, the author explores the definition, characteristics and the technique to manage big data, but he also focuses his attention on the challenges of this way of thinking and on how big data are changing existing epistemology and science. Before the big data revolution, the scientific approach was based on computational science based on the simulation of complex phenomena. In the age of big data, however, an exploratory approach based on data-intensive, statistical exploration and data mining was used. In the age of big data, however, an exploratory approach based on data-intensive, statistical exploration and data mining is used. The author focuses his attention on how big data are changing the approaches and methodologies in four different fields, that is, governing people, managing organizations, leveraging value and producing capitals, creating better places in which to live. The aim of the book is threefold: to provide a detailed reflection on the nature of the data and their wider assemblages; to chart how these assemblages are shifting and mutating all along the development of new data infrastructures; and to reflect on the consequences that these new ways to assemble data may entail the making of sense and on the effects they produce in the world. The 11 chapters ideally can be divided into two main sections. The first section (chapters 1\u20136) deals with the big data characteristics and the techniques to manage them. The last section (chapters 7\u201311) consider how big data are changing the epistemology of science across all domains (arts and humanities, social and life sciences, engineering). The interest of these last chapters lies in the core idea of data being not self-meaningful, as their meaningfulness is proportionate to the information they can provide. This is particularly interesting as it fosters dense insights and ideas on further development in research. The book starts with the definition of big data and enhances the concept by which data do not exist independently from the ideas, instruments, practices, context and knowledge used to generate, process, analyze and draw conclusions from them. The book continues with an analysis of the data characteristics. Data vary by forms (qualitative and quantitative), structure (structured, semi-structured and unstructured), source (captured, derived, exhaust, transient), producer (primary, secondary, tertiary), and type (indexical, attribute, metadata). However, these different types of data share the same characteristic as they all form the basis of the knowledge pyramid where data precede information which, in turn, precedes knowledge. The latter precedes understanding and wisdom. In order to make sense of data, they are usually pooled into datasets and databases designed and organized to enable specific analysis. How they are structured has consequences on the queries and obtainable results. The author underlines the importance of the data assembly process as an issue that needs further attention and research. Chapter 4 explores big data characteristics, that is, volume, velocity, variety, exhaustivity, resolution/indexicality, relationality and flexibility/scalability. The author then examines the interest that the access to large data with those specific characteristics may have for society, governments and business organizations. Chapter 5 concerns the sources of big data. The starting point is that the production of big data has been facilitated by the confluence of five technological innovations: growing computational power, internet, pervasive and ubiquitous computing, indexical and machine readable identification, and massive distributed storage. The data production can be divided into three categories, that is, directed data (generated by traditional forms of surveillance), automated data (generated by automatic function of the device or systems) and volunteered data (traded or gifted by people to a system). Once again, with his critical approach, the author underlines the importance of developing empirical studies to examine in depth the various ways in which big data are being generated, Regional Studies, 2016",

            "abstract": "Heterogeneous computing denotes a scenario where different computing platforms are exploited for specific applications (Danovaro et al., 2014). While the demand for computational resources continues to grow with increasing need for querying and analyzing the volumes and rates of Big Data, energy efficiency is limiting the traditional approach to improve the compute capabilities of a data center by adding thousands of state-of-the-art x86 machines to an existing infrastructure in favor of adopting energy savvy devices (Cesini et al., 2017; D\u2019Agostino et al., 2019). The result is that the computing nodes in data centers have different execution models, ranging from the traditional x68 architecture to GPUs, FPGAs (Papadimitriou et al., 2020) and other processor types like ARMs or more specialized processors as TPUs (Albrecht et al., 2019; Cass, 2019). For example, GPUs are used in many scientific applications based on regular domains and are delivering performance that is orders of magnitude better than traditional cores. They are also widely used in deep learning, especially the machine learning training phase. The FPGAs, being integrated circuits that can be configured by the programmer to implement a certain function, tries to close the gap between hardware and software. Within this context the research topic collects five papers showing very interesting experiences in adopting heterogeneous architectures, for AI and Big Data applications in High Energy Physics. In GPU-accelerated machine learning inference as a service for computing in neutrino experiments (Wang et al.) the authors discuss the performance achieved by exploiting GPU resources as a service for the ProtoDUNE-SP reconstruction chain developed in the context of the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). This contribution represents one of the first experiences in which machine learning is acceleratedis accelerated with GPUs in neutrino software frameworks. The most time-consuming task, the track and particle shower hit identification, has been accelerated by a factor of 17. In Heterogeneous reconstruction of tracks and primary vertices with the CMS pixel tracker (Bocci et al.) the authors describe an heterogeneous implementation of pixel tracks and vertices reconstruction chain on GPUs able to achieve high performance speedup values. The resulting framework has been developed for being integrated in the CMS particle detector reconstruction software, CMSSW (http://cms-sw.github.io), which is employed to detect particle and phenomena resulting from high-energy collisions in the LHC by the CMS experiment. In Distance-Weighted Graph Neural Networks on FPGAs for Real-Time Particle Reconstruction in High Energy Physics (Iiyama et al.) the authors present a novel method to export graph neural networks from complex modern machine learning packages to an efficient FPGA implementation.

            "abstract": "Purpose \n \n \n \n \nCompetitor analysis is a key component in operations management. Most business decisions are rooted in the analysis of rival products inferred from market structure. Relative to more traditional competitor analysis methods, the purpose of this paper is to provide operations managers with an innovative tool to monitor a firm\u2019s market position and competitors in real time at higher resolution and lower cost than more traditional competitor analysis methods. \n \n \n \n \nDesign/methodology/approach \n \n \n \n \nThe authors combine the techniques of Web Crawler, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning algorithms with data visualization to develop a big data competitor-analysis system that informs operations managers about competitors and meaningful relationships among them. The authors illustrate the approach using the fitness mobile app business. \n \n \n \n \nFindings \n \n \n \n \nThe study shows that the system supports operational decision making both descriptively and prescriptively. In particular, the innovative probabilistic topic modeling algorithm combined with conventional multidimensional scaling, product feature comparison and market structure analyses reveal an app\u2019s position in relation to its peers. The authors also develop a user segment overlapping index based on user\u2019s social media data. The authors combine this new index with the product functionality similarity index to map indirect and direct competitors with and without user lock-in. \n \n \n \n \nOriginality/value \n \n \n \n \nThe approach improves on previous approaches by fully automating information extraction from multiple online sources. The authors believe this is the first system of its kind. With limited human intervention, the methodology can easily be adapted to different settings, giving quicker, more reliable real-time results. The approach is also cost effective for market analysis projects covering different data sources.",

            "abstract": "With the rapid growth of emerging applications like social network analysis, semantic Web analysis and bioinformatics network analysis, a variety of data to be processed continues to witness a quick increase. Effective management and analysis of large-scale data poses an interesting but critical challenge. Recently, big data has attracted a lot of attention from academia, industry as well as government. This paper introduces several big data processing technics from system and application aspects. First, from the view of cloud data management and big data processing mechanisms, we present the key issues of big data processing, including cloud computing platform, cloud architecture, cloud database and data storage scheme. Following the Map Reduce parallel processing framework, we then introduce Map Reduce optimization strategies and applications reported in the literature. Finally, we discuss the open issues and challenges, and deeply explore the research directions in the future on big data processing in cloud computing environments.",

            "abstract": "The explosive growth of demands on big data processing imposes a heavy burden on computation, storage, and communication in data centers, which hence incurs considerable operational expenditure to data center providers. Therefore, cost minimization has become an emergent issue for the upcoming big data era. Different from conventional cloud services, one of the main features of big data services is the tight coupling between data and computation as computation tasks can be conducted only when the corresponding data are available. As a result, three factors, i.e., task assignment, data placement, and data movement, deeply influence the operational expenditure of data centers. In this paper, we are motivated to study the cost minimization problem via a joint optimization of these three factors for big data services in geo-distributed data centers. To describe the task completion time with the consideration of both data transmission and computation, we propose a 2-D Markov chain and derive the average task completion time in closed-form. Furthermore, we model the problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming and propose an efficient solution to linearize it. The high efficiency of our proposal is validated by extensive simulation-based studies.",

The data may be presented in various types and formats: structured, semi-structured and unstructured. For instance, data can be modeled as relational, key-value, and graph models. Having a single data platform for managing both well-structured data and NoSQL data is beneficial to users; this approach reduces significantly integration, migration, development, maintenance, and operational issues. Therefore, a challenging research work is how to develop an efficient consolidated single data management platform covering both NoSQL and relational data to reduce integration issues, simplify operations, and eliminate migration issues. In this paper, we envision novel principles and technologies to handle multiple models of data in one unified database system, including model-agnostic storage, unified query processing and indexes, in-memory structures and multi-model transactions. We discuss our visions as well as present research challenges that we need to address.",

            "abstract": "Scalable subsequence matching is critical for supporting analytics on big time series from mining, prediction to hypothesis testing. However, state-of-the-art subsequence matching techniques do not scale well to TB-scale datasets. Not only does index construction become prohibitively expensive, but also the query response time deteriorates quickly as the length of the query subsequence exceeds several 100s of data points. Although Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) has emerged as a promising solution for indexing long time series, it relies on expensive hash functions that perform multiple passes over the data and thus is impractical for big time series. In this work, we propose a lightweight distributed indexing framework, called ChainLink, that supports approximate kNN queries over TB-scale time series data. As a foundation of ChainLink, we design a novel hashing technique, called Single Pass Signature (SPS), that successfully tackles the above problem. In particular, we prove theoretically and demonstrate experimentally that the similarity proximity of the indexed subsequences is preserved by our proposed single-pass SPS scheme. Leveraging this SPS innovation, Chainlink then adopts a three-step approach for scalable index building: (1) in-place data re-organization within each partition to enable efficient record-level random access to all subsequences, (2) parallel building of hash-based local indices on top of the re-organized data using our SPS scheme for efficient search within each partition, and (3) efficient aggregation of the local indices to construct a centralized yet highly compact global index for effective pruning of irrelevant partitions during query processing. ChainLink achieves the above three steps in one single map-reduce process. Our experimental evaluation shows that ChainLink indices are compact at less than 2% of dataset size while state-of-the-art index sizes tend to be almost the same size as the dataset. Better still, ChainLink is up to 2 orders of magnitude faster in its index construction time compared to state-of-the-art techniques, while improving both the final query response time by up to 10 fold and the result accuracy by 15%.",

            "abstract": "Big data refers to large complex structured or unstructured data sets. Big data technologies enable organisations to generate, collect, manage, analyse, and visualise big data sets, and provide insights to inform diagnosis, prediction, or other decision-making tasks. One of the critical concerns in handling big data is the adoption of appropriate big data governance frameworks to (1) curate big data in a required manner to support quality data access for effective machine learning and (2) ensure the framework regulates the storage and processing of the data from providers and users in a trustworthy way within the related regulatory frameworks (both legally and ethically). This paper proposes a framework of big data governance that guides organisations to make better data-informed business decisions within the related regularity framework, with close attention paid to data security, privacy, and accessibility. In order to demonstrate this process, the work also presents an example implementation of the framework based on the case study of big data governance in cybersecurity. This framework has the potential to guide the management of big data in different organisations for information sharing and cooperative decision-making.",

            "abstract": "The increasing main memory capacity and the explosion of big data have fueled the development of in-memory big data management and processing. By offering an efficient in-memory parallel execution model which can eliminate disk I/O bottleneck, existing in-memory cluster computing platforms (e.g., Flink and Spark) have already been proven to be outstanding platforms for big data processing. However, these platforms are merely CPU-based systems. This paper proposes GFlink, an in-memory computing architecture on heterogeneous CPU-GPU clusters for big data. Our proposed architecture extends the original Flink from CPU clusters to heterogeneous CPU-GPU clusters, greatly improving the computational power of Flink. Furthermore, we have proposed a programming framework based on Flink's abstract model, i.e., DataSet (DST), hiding the programming complexity of GPUs behind the simple and familiar high-level interfaces. To achieve high performance and good load-balance, an efficient JVM-GPU communication strategy, a GPU cache scheme, and an adaptive locality-aware scheduling scheme for three-stage pipelining execution are proposed. Extensive experiment results indicate that the high computational power of GPUs can be efficiently utilized, and the implementation on GFlink outperforms that on the original CPU-based Flink.",

            "abstract": "PurposeThis research unpacks the micro-mechanisms that exist between an organisation's ability to conduct big data analytics (BDA) and its achievement of strategic flexibility. Knowledge management capabilities and organisational ambidexterity have long been considered factors influencing the aforementioned relationship. In order to assess this, the authors build on dynamic capabilities as the main theoretical lens through which to examine.Design/methodology/approachStructural equation modelling (SEM) is the main methodological approach used in this research. A structural model was developed and tested based on 215 survey responses collected from managers of organisations in continental Europe.FindingsThe results indicate that BDA capabilities are a significant antecedent of an organisation's strategic flexibility. This relationship, however, is influenced by knowledge management capabilities and ambidexterity.Practical implicationsManagers wishing to properly exploit the potential of big data should invest in the elaboration of knowledge management processes across their organisation. This strategy can foster strategic flexibility.Originality/valuePrevious research has explored the theoretical links between big data, knowledge management and strategic flexibility. However, little attention has been paid to the quantitative investigation of the phenomenon.",

In Big Data definition, Big means a dataset which makes data concept to grow so much that it becomes difficult to manage it by using existing data management concepts and tools. Map Reduce is playing a very significant role in processing of Big Data. This paper includes a brief about Big Data and its related issues, emphasizes on role of MapReduce in Big Data processing. MapReduce is elastic scalable, efficient and fault tolerant for analysing a large set of data, highlights the features of MapReduce in comparison of other design model which makes it popular tool for processing large scale data. Analysis of performance factors of MapReduce shows that elimination of their inverse effect by optimization improves the performance of Map Reduce.",

            "title": "Interactive and Scalable Exploration of Big Spatial Data -- A Data Management Perspective",
            "abstract": "Recently, the volume of available spatial data increased tremendously. For instance, in November 2013 NASA announced the release of hundreds of Terabytes of its earth remote sensing dataset. Such data includes but not limited to: weather maps, socioeconomic data, vegetation indices, geological maps, and more. Making sense of such spatial data will be beneficial for several applications that may transform science and society -- For example: (1) Space Science: that allows astronomers to study and probably discover new features of both the earth and the outer space, (2) Socio-Economic Analysis: that includes for example climate change analysis, study of deforestation, population migration, and variation in sea levels, (3) Urban Planning: assisting government in city planning, road network design, and transportation engineering, (4) Disaster Planning: that helps in assessing the impact of natural disasters. The main aim of this paper is to investigate novel data management techniques that enable interactive and scalable exploration of big spatial data. The paper envisions novel system architectures that provide support for interactive and spatial data exploration, as follows: (1) The paper suggests extending data analytics frameworks, e.g., Apache Spark, to support spatial data types and operations at scale. The resulting framework will serve as a scalable backbone for processing spatial data exploration tasks. (2) It also sketches novel structures and algorithms that leverage modern hardware, e.g., SSDs, and in-memory data processing techniques to efficiently store and access spatial data. Second, the paper proposes extending spatial database systems to support an exploration-aware spatial query evaluation paradigm through three novel components: (1) Spatial Query Steering: that allows the user to slightly modify the query conditions online (zooming in/out) and retrieve the new results in very low latency. (2) Recommendation-Aware Spatial Querying: that injects the recommendation functionality inside classical spatial query executors to support spatial data recommendation. It leverages recommendation algorithms to predict what spatial objects/areas the user would like based on her past interactions with the system. (3) Spatial Query Approximation: That aims at achieving interactive performance by studying the tradeoff between approximate spatial data exploration and query response time.",

Earth and Environmental sciences are likely to benefit from Big Data Analytics techniques supporting the processing of the large number of Earth Observation datasets currently acquired and generated through observations and simulations. However, Earth Science data and applications present specificities in terms of relevance of the geospatial information, wide heterogeneity of data models and formats, and complexity of processing. Therefore, Big Earth Data Analytics requires specifically tailored techniques and tools. The EarthServer Big Earth Data Analytics engine offers a solution for coverage-type datasets, built around a high performance array database technology, and the adoption and enhancement of standards for service interaction (OGC WCS and WCPS). The EarthServer solution, led by the collection of requirements from scientific communities and international initiatives, provides a holistic approach that ranges from query languages and scalability up to mobile access and visualization. The result is demonstrated and validated through the development of lighthouse applications in the Marine, Geology, Atmospheric, Planetary and Cryospheric science domains.",

            "abstract": "With the rapid growth of storage providers, data deduplication is an essential storage optimization technique that greatly minimizes data storage costs by storing a unique copy of duplicate data. Nowadays, deduplication introduces various new challenges such as security and insufficient space issue. Hence, in this article, we propose a secure data deduplication with access control of big data over HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)/Hadoop environment, called SecDedoop. First, the system achieves security for data confidentiality by third party vendor using elliptic curve cryptography. There are two types of keys (public key and private key) generated for data retrieval. Second, we consider data deduplication. The user's original file is divided into a number of equal chunks. Then, each chunk (e.g., 1. txt) is tokenized into words and the weight of words is computed by using TF-IDF frequency. The SHA-3 hash computation is performed to the user's original file. If the hash value is not duplicate, then we store data in HDFS. The PSO (particle swarm optimization)-based MapReduce model is the proposed best data node selection. Initially, MapReduce process is finished for the user's original file and it results in the best set of data nodes; then, we apply PSO to compute the fitness value for best data node selection. Further, we consider MongoDB for fast indexing of the user's original files and also apply FCM (fuzzy-C-means clustering) for clustering the user's files. In this article, we consider the modified version of PSO and FCM to eliminate the open issues in conventional PSO and FCM. The performance of our proposed SecDedoop has been evaluated by using various performance metrics and also proved it outperforms better than previous approaches.",

In the big data technology system, big data collection is the basis. The storage, analysis, integration and visualization of unstructured data and semi-structured data will become an important focus of the big data innovation. Traditional structured data will no longer be the core of big data. Based on the life cycle theory, using new digital technology, such as acquisition, processing, storage, organization and copyright protection, clusters of high concurrency retrieval and dynamic scheduling, intelligent digital display, coal mine industry information data can be collected and integrated, to realize centralized management, unified retrieval and joint exhibition of information resources, to provide technical means and reference for the digital construction of heterogeneous coal mine information data by means of big data thinking.",

The novel availability of information offered by these digital technologies can lead to the definition of strategies aimed at significantly reducing management costs and improving building performance and service quality. Although this potential is now widely recognized by the various operators in the sector, experimentations have not yet led to a harmonization and standardization of procedures, processes and enabling technologies applications. The paper proposes strategies and tools for supporting the various FM operators in the choice and implementation of IoT technologies as well as in the management of Big Data and their sources, aiming at optimizing and innovating the current FM processes, models and services.",

            "abstract": "The big data era brought us new data processing, data management challenges to face. Existing state-of-theart analytics tools come now close to handle ongoing challenges, provide satisfactory results with reasonable cost. But the speed at which new data is generated, the need to manage changes in data both for content, structure lead to new rising challenges. This is especially true in the context of complex systems with strong dynamics, as in for instance large scale ambient systems. One existing technology that has been shown as particularly relevant for modeling, simulating, solving problems in complex systems are Multi-Agent Systems. This article aims at exploring, describing how such a technology can be applied to big data in the form of an Adaptive Multi-Agent System providing dynamic analytics capabilities. This ongoing research has promising outcomes but will need to be discussed, validated. It is currently being applied in the neOCampus project, the ambient campus of the University of Toulouse III.",

            "abstract": "The emerging field of Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS) provides a way to organise, store and analyse spatio-temporal data at multiple resolutions and scales (from near global scales down to microns). DGGS partition the entire planet into a discrete hierarchy of global tessellations of progressively finer resolution zones (or cells). Data integration, decomposition and aggregation are optimised by assigning a unique spatio-temporal identifier to each zone. These identifiers are encodings of both the zone\u2019s location and its resolution. As a result, complex multi-dimensional, multi-resolution spatio-temporal operations are simplified into sets of 1D array and filter operations. DGGS are therefore particularly suited for efficient multi-source data processing, storage, discovery, transmission, visualisation, computation, analysis, and modelling. DGGS are supported by both the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) TC211 standards (OGC Abstract Specification \u2013 Topic 21 1 , ISO 19170-1 2 ). These published specifications support 2D equal-area DGGS of the Earth\u2019s surface. Current work led through both OGC and ISO/TC-211 is drafting standards to specify 3D (3D & equi-volume) 3 , 4D (spatio-temporal) 4 and axis-aligned 5 DGGS, as well as OGC API DGGS 6 , 7 interface encodings for DGGS infrastructures. The continued effort to develop international standards for DGGS will support the implementation of standardised interoperable Global Reference Grid Infrastructures that can support efficient and scalable integration of Big Earth Data across multiple organisations around the world.

            "abstract": "With the rapid growth of emerging applications like social network, semantic web, sensor networks and LBS (Location Based Service) applications, a variety of data to be processed continues to witness a quick increase. Effective management and processing of large-scale data poses an interesting but critical challenge. Recently, big data has attracted a lot of attention from academia, industry as well as government. This paper introduces several big data processing techniques from system and application aspects. First, from the view of cloud data management and big data processing mechanisms, we present the key issues of big data processing, including definition of big data, big data management platform, big data service models, distributed file system, data storage, data virtualization platform and distributed applications. Following the MapReduce parallel processing framework, we introduce some MapReduce optimization strategies reported in the literature. Finally, we discuss the open issues and challenges, and deeply explore the research directions in the future on big data processing in cloud computing environments.",

            "abstract": "Fast increasing volumes of spatial data has made it imperative to develop both scalable and efficient spatial data management techniques by leveraging modern parallel hardware and distributed systems. By integrating a leading open source Big Data system called Impala and our previous work on data parallel designs for spatial indexing and query processing, we have developed ISP-MC+ and ISP-GPU for large-scale spatial data management on computer clusters equipped with multi-core CPUs and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), respectively. Both ISP-MC+ and ISP-GPU have shown high efficiency and good scalability on a 10-node Amazon EC2 cluster equipped with multi-core CPUs and GPUs. Comparison with a baseline implementation using traditional techniques on a single CPU core have demonstrated orders of magnitude of speedups on a real world dataset with hundreds of millions of point locations.",

This framework provides a wide range of functions, including data collection, smart data preprocessing, smart data mining and smart data visualization.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe architecture of CPS was designed with cyber layer, physical layer and communication layer from the perspective of big data processing. The BDA model was integrated into a CPS that enables managers to make sound decisions.\n\n\nFindings\nThe effectiveness of the proposed BDA model has been demonstrated by two practical cases \u2212 the prediction of energy output of the power grid and the estimate of the remaining useful life of the aero-engine. The method can be used to control the power supply system and help engineers to maintain or replace the aero-engine to maintain the safety of the aircraft.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe communication layer, which connects the cyber layer and physical layer, was designed in CPS. From the communication layer, the redundant raw data can be converted into smart data. All the necessary functions of data collection, data preprocessing, data storage, data mining and data visualization can be effectively integrated into the BDA model for CPS applications. These findings show that the proposed BDA model in CPS can be used in different environments and applications.\n",

            "abstract": "A Cloud may be seen as a type of flexible computing infrastructure consisting of many compute nodes, where resizable computing capacities can be provided to different customers. To fully harness the power of the Cloud, efficient data management is needed to handle huge volumes of data and support a large number of concurrent end users. To achieve that, a scalable and high-throughput indexing scheme is generally required. Such an indexing scheme must not only incur a low maintenance cost but also support parallel search to improve scalability. In this paper, we present a novel, scalable B+-tree based indexing scheme for efficient data processing in the Cloud. Our approach can be summarized as follows. First, we build a local B+-tree index for each compute node which only indexes data residing on the node. Second, we organize the compute nodes as a structured overlay and publish a portion of the local B+-tree nodes to the overlay for efficient query processing. Finally, we propose an adaptive algorithm to select the published B+-tree nodes according to query patterns. We conduct extensive experiments on Amazon's EC2, and the results demonstrate that our indexing scheme is dynamic, efficient and scalable.",

            "abstract": "Object storage has been increasingly adopted in high-performance computing for scientific, big data applications. With object storage, applications usually use object IDs, queries, or collections to identify the data instead of using files. Since the object store changes the way data is accessed in applications, it introduces new challenges for I/O prediction, which used to work based on interfile or intrafile pattern detection. The key challenge is that the inputs of object-based applications are no longer expressed as static file names: they become much more dynamic and unstable, hidden inside application logic. Traditional prediction strategies do not work well in such conditions. In this paper, we introduce the use of provenance information, which was collected for data management in high-performance computing systems, in order to build an accurate coarse-grained (object-level) input prediction. The prediction results can be preloaded into a burst buffer to accelerate future reads. To our best knowledge, this study is the first to use provenance information in object stores to predict application inputs. Evaluation results confirm the effectiveness and accuracy of our provenance-based prediction and show that the proposed prediction system is feasible for real-work deployment.",

ECG data generated cannot be real-time accumulated, processed, and used for enterprise-level healthcare and wellness services with the existing cardiovascular monitoring system used in hospitals. This study aims to assess the feasibility of a cyber-physical cardiac monitoring system to classify stroke patients with altered cardiac activity and healthy adults. Here, we propose Big-ECG, a cyber-physical cardiac monitoring system for stroke management, consisting of a wearable ECG sensor, data storage and data analysis in a big data platform, and health advisory services using data analytics and medical ontology. We investigated our proposed ECG-based patient monitoring system with 45 stroke patients (average age 70.8 years old, 68% men) admitted to the rehabilitation center of the hospital and 40 healthy elderly volunteers (average age 75.4 years old, 38% men). We recorded ECG at resting state using a single-channel ECG patch within three months of diagnosis of ischemic stroke (clinically confirmed). In statistical results, ECG fiducial features, RR-I, QRS, QT, ST, and heart rate variability (HRV) features, SDSD, LF/HF, LF/(LF + HF), and HF/(LF + HF) are observed as significantly distinctive biomarkers for the stroke group relative to the healthy control group. The Random Trees model presented the best classification performance (overall accuracy: 95.6%) utilizing ECG fiducial variables. This system may assist healthcare enterprises in prognosis and rehabilitation management during post-stroke treatment.",

            "abstract": "Heterogeneous data types, widely distributed data sources, huge data volumes, and large-scale business-alliance partners describe typical global supply chain operational environments. Mobile and wireless technologies are putting an extra layer of data source in this technology-enriched supply chain operation. This environment also needs to provide access to data anywhere, anytime to its end-users. This new type of data set originating from the global retail supply chain is commonly known as big data because of its huge volume, resulting from the velocity with which it arrives in the global retail business environment. Such environments empower and necessitate decision makers to act or react quicker to all decision tasks. Academics and practitioners are researching and building the next generation of big-data-based application software systems. This new generation of software applications is based on complex data analysis algorithms (i.e., on data that does not adhere to standard relational data models). The traditional software testing methods are insufficient for big-data-based applications. Testing big-data-based applications is one of the biggest challenges faced by modern software design and development communities because of lack of knowledge on what to test and how much data to test. Big-data-based applications developers have been facing a daunting task in defining the best strategies for structured and unstructured data validation, setting up an optimal test environment, and working with non-relational databases testing approaches. This chapter focuses on big-data-based software testing and quality-assurance-related issues in the context of Hadoop, an open source framework. It includes discussion about several challenges with respect to massively parallel data generation from multiple sources, testing methods for validation of pre-Hadoop processing, software application quality factors, and some of the software testing mechanisms for this new breed of applications",

These groundbreaking paradigms are leading IT to a new set of rules that aims to change computing resources delivery and exploitation model, thus creating a novel business market that is exponentially growing and attracting more and more investments from both providers and end users that are looking forward to make profits from these innovative models of computing. In the same context, researchers and investigators are wrestling time in order to develop, test and optimize Cloud Computing and Big Data platforms, whereas several studies are ongoing to determine and enhance the essential aspects of these computing models especially compute resources allocation. The processing power scheduling is crucial when it comes to Cloud Computing and Big Data because of the data growth management and delivery design proposed by these new computing models, that requires faster responses from platforms and applications. Hence originates the importance of developing high efficient scheduling algorithms that are compliant with these computing models platforms and infrastructures requirement.",

The promises of these two projects were to model the complex interaction of brain and behavior and to understand and diagnose brain diseases by collecting and analyzing large quanitites of data. Archiving, analyzing, and sharing the growing neuroimaging datasets posed major challenges. New computational methods and technologies have emerged in the domain of Big Data but have not been fully adapted for use in neuroimaging. In this work, we introduce the current challenges of neuroimaging in a big data context. We review our efforts toward creating a data management system to organize the large-scale fMRI datasets, and present our novel algorithms/methods for the distributed fMRI data processing that employs Hadoop and Spark. Finally, we demonstrate the significant performance gains of our algorithms/methods to perform distributed dictionary learning.",

For that reason, it becomes necessary to deal with this massive volume of data with caution and care in a term to make sure that the data used and produced is in high quality. Therefore, the Big Data quality is must, and its rules have to be satisfied. In this paper, the main Big Data Quality Factors, which need to be measured, is presented in the perspective of the data itself, the data management, data processing, and data users. This research highlights the quality factors that may be used later to create different Big Data quality models.",

Big Data is typically characterized by three V's: Volume, Variety and Velocity. Supporting these properties raises significant challenges in a cloud setting, including partitioning for scale out; replication across data centers for fault-tolerance; significant latency overheads due to consistency requirements; efficient traversal needs due to high update and velocity; and continuous maintenance in the presence of large variety of data representations. Last but not least, the storage of private data necessitates the ability to efficiently execute queries in a privacy preserving manner (P), without revealing user access patterns. In this paper we highlight these challenges and illustrate sample state of the art solutions.",

The existing relational databases are no longer able to meet the business requirements of real-time or non-real-time data storage, processing and retrieval. The Hadoop ecosystem, combining with the Elasticsearch cluster (ES cluster) is used to build the meteorological big data platform. The real-time data is processed by Kafka message queue, combing with the Storm DataAnly topology and finally enters the ES cluster. The non-real-time data is mainly processed by the file monitoring component. The file metadata information such as indexes is stored in the ES cluster. The files are saved in the HDFS. The implemented Big Data platform can process about 1.5 million real-time and non-real-time meteorological data per day, while the Elasticsearch cluster can provide ultrafast searching at a speed level of millisecond in a dataset of 2.0million. Experiments show that the meteorological big data platform can meet the needs of modern meteorological business.",

            "abstract": "Multidimensional array data, such as remote-sensing imagery and timeseries, climate model simulations, telescope observations, and medical images, contribute massively to virtually all science and engineering domains, and hence play a key role in 'Big Data' challenges. Pure array storage management and analytics is relatively well understood today. However, arrays in practice never come alone, but are accompanied by metadata, including domain, range, provenance information, etc. The structure of this metadata is far less regular than arrays or tables, and may be incomplete or different from one array instance to another. Particularly in the field of the Semantic Web such integrated representations must convey a sufficiently complete and reasonable semantics for machine-machine communication. We show how the Resource Description Framework (RDF), the Semantic Web graph model for metadata, can be leveraged for such data/metadata integration specifically for representing spatio-temporal grid data. Based on the notion of a coverage as established by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) we present a hybrid data store where efficiently represented arrays are incorporated as nodes into RDF graphs and connected to their metadata. We have extended the Semantic Web query language SPARQL to incorporate array query semantics and other functionality making it suitable for processing of large numeric arrays, including geo coverages.",

            "abstract": "The adoption of e-learning systems in higher education is a remarkable phenomenon that has redefined teaching and learning. Initially, it was proposed to allow people to learn for personal accomplishment without physically attending any traditional university or academic settings. While these systems continue to provide an efficient and flexible approach for teaching and learning, the rapid integration of ICTs and the expansion of data from these systems remain much concern to the education community. In this study, we propose a smart and secure data flow architectural framework for e-learning that uses a rich set of big data tools within a distributed and parallel analysis platform. Reference Model of Open Distributed Processing (RM-ODP) reference model guided the development of this Big Data framework for e-learning analytics. Using the RM-ODP model as a benchmark, we classify the educational institution's architecture in terms of existing elements, functions and processes to understand stakeholders' views for the development of the framework. Our approach uses an existing distributed computing environment and offers an adaptable standard framework to improve the data acquisition, storage, processing, analysis, security and virtualization for e-learning systems. We implement a scalable and adaptable big data framework for e-learning (BiDeL) and point out how big data concept could integrate into online learning systems to improve teaching and learning in higher education using Apache Spark as a case. The proposed framework was applied to both batch and streaming dataset of students online activities on moodle LMSs. BiDel framework performance shows improved data integration and data governance. This big data framework and the general view of the current state of the art in \u201cbig data\u201d technologies will serve as a guide for the creation of e-learning systems, which create new value from existing but underused data. The acquired value will provide decision-makers in higher education with new insights from data to enhance productivity in teaching and learning. These insights can lead to innovation, competitiveness in the academic space and even create entirely new teaching and learning models.",

            "abstract": "Analysis and processing of very large data sets, or big data, poses a significant challenge. Massive data sets are collected and studied in numerous domains, from engineering sciences to social networks, biomolecular research, commerce, and security. Extracting valuable information from big data requires innovative approaches that efficiently process large amounts of data as well as handle and, moreover, utilize their structure. This article discusses a paradigm for large-scale data analysis based on the discrete signal processing (DSP) on graphs (DSPG). DSPG extends signal processing concepts and methodologies from the classical signal processing theory to data indexed by general graphs. Big data analysis presents several challenges to DSPG, in particular, in filtering and frequency analysis of very large data sets. We review fundamental concepts of DSPG, including graph signals and graph filters, graph Fourier transform, graph frequency, and spectrum ordering, and compare them with their counterparts from the classical signal processing theory. We then consider product graphs as a graph model that helps extend the application of DSPG methods to large data sets through efficient implementation based on parallelization and vectorization. We relate the presented framework to existing methods for large-scale data processing and illustrate it with an application to data compression.",

            "abstract": "Workflow scheduling has remained a critical functionality of modern data-centric workflow management systems. Cloud computing, which provides practically unlimited computing and storage resources, has enabled a new generation of data-centric workflows, called big data workflows. New big data workflow scheduling algorithms should optimally utilize the characteristics of cloud computing such as heterogeneous virtual machines, the elastic resource provisioning model, and the pay-as-you-go pricing model, as well as the time and monetary cost to transfer large amounts of data. In this paper, we consider one case of the general big data workflow scheduling problem where a deadline, \u03b4, is given for a workflow, W, and the goal is to minimize the monetary cost of running W in the cloud while satisfying the given deadline, \u03b4. To this end, we leverage the power of Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) in order to search for the best solution within a reasonable planning time. More specifically, we introduce an innovative fitness function that combines the time and monetary cost of a workflow in one metric. Based on the EA and the fitness function, we design a deadline-constrained big data workflow scheduling algorithm, called iCATS (Improved Cultural Algorithms-based Task Scheduling). Extensive experiments demonstrate the statistical advantages of iCATS over existing representative EA workflow scheduling algorithms, including random (Rand), Genetic Algorithms (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Cultural Algorithms (CA).",

            "abstract": "The management of hot work is the key element of petroleum refinery safety management. A large amount of hot-work data has been accumulated, which is underexploited. Driving new insights using big data analytics is the trend. However, there have been few scientific studies on solving a specific problem using big data method in the field of safety management. Hence, the unstructured-data analysis of the hot-work permit-to-work text was investigated. The professional corpus in the hot-work field was constructed using word segmentation, stop list elimination, standardized process, and manual proofreading. All hot-work content collocates were manually grouped into semantic domains in the light of experts\u2019 experience. The data-driven reduction models of hot work number were proposed aiming at possible invalid hot work, long-time hot work, repetitive hot work and possible equipment defect. Based on the proposed reduction models, we mined the patterns of hot work and the unnecessary or high-risk hot work could be identified automatically. The result of the reduction model in training set indicated that the reduction models are reasonable. The reduction model 1, reduction model 2, reduction model 3, reduction model 4 could reduce the proportion of hot work number 5%, 3%, 4%, and 2%, respectively. Thus, the targeted measures could be put forward to optimize the safety management of hot work.",

            "abstract": "Due to the large volume of data and information generated by a multitude of social data sources, it is a huge challenge to manage and extract useful knowledge, especially given the different forms of data, streaming data and uncertainty and ambiguity of data. Hence, there are still challenges in this area of BD analytics research to capture, store, process, visualise, query, and manipulate datasets to derive meaningful information that is specific to an application's domain. This chapter attempts to address this problem by studying Semantic Analytics and domain knowledge modelling, and to what extent these technologies can be utilised toward better understanding to the social textual contents. In particular, the chapter gives an overview of semantic analysis and domain ontology followed by shedding light on domain knowledge modelling, inference, semantic storage, and publicly available semantic tools and APIs. Also, the theoretical notion of Knowledge Graphs is reported and their interlinking with SBD is discussed. The utility of the semantic analytics is demonstrated and evaluated through a case study on social data in the context of politics domain.",

            "abstract": "In the era of Big Data, a great attention deserves the visualization of large data sets. Among the main phases of the data management\u2019s life cycle, i.e., storage, analytics and visualization, the last one is the most strategic since it is close to the human perspective. The huge mine of data becomes a gold mine only if tricky and wise analytics algorithms are executed over the data deluge and, at the same time, the analytic process results are visualized in an effective, efficient and why not impressive way. Not surprisingly, a plethora of tools and techniques have emerged in the last years for Big Data visualization, both as part of Data Management Systems or as software or plugins specifically devoted to the data visualization. Starting from these considerations, this paper provides a survey of the most used and spread visualization tools and techniques for large data sets, eventually presenting a synoptic of the main functional and non-functional characteristics of the surveyed",

            "abstract": "In the Big Data community, MapReduce has been seen as one of the key enabling approaches for meeting continuously increasing demands on computing resources imposed by massive data sets. The reason for this is the high scalability of the MapReduce paradigm which allows for massively parallel and distributed execution over a large number of computing nodes. This paper identifies MapReduce issues and challenges in handling Big Data with the objective of providing an overview of the field, facilitating better planning and management of Big Data projects, and identifying opportunities for future research in this field. The identified challenges are grouped into four main categories corresponding to Big Data tasks types: data storage (relational databases and NoSQL stores), Big Data analytics (machine learning and interactive analytics), online processing, and security and privacy. Moreover, current efforts aimed at improving and extending MapReduce to address identified challenges are presented. Consequently, by identifying issues and challenges MapReduce faces when handling Big Data, this study encourages future Big Data research.",

Under such background, a group character-oriented exercise health monitoring solution is put forward. This paper combines with Hadoop cluster to store and analyze mass motion data, and integrates with data processing algorithm and conversion algorithm to quantify various physical activities. We use Hadoop open source framework to design and realize motion information analysis service platform. It respectively processes and analyzes the distributed mass physical activity data from two perspectives of motion individuals and the motion group to obtain analysis results of various data. Finally, the paper designs Android-based query and management of motion information to understand physical activity of students' group intensively.",

This data is the foundation for a broad spectrum of services driven and improved by trajectory data mining. However, for hybrid transactional and analytical workloads, the storing and processing of rapidly accumulated trajectory data is a non-trivial task. In this paper, we present a detailed survey about state-of-the-art trajectory data management systems. To determine the relevant aspects and requirements for such systems, we developed a trajectory data mining framework, which summarizes the different steps in the trajectory data mining process. Based on the derived requirements, we analyze different concepts to store, compress, index, and process spatio-temporal data. There are various trajectory management systems, which are optimized for scalability, data footprint reduction, elasticity, or query performance. To get a comprehensive overview, we describe and compare different exciting systems. Additionally, the observed similarities in the general structure of different systems are consolidated in a general blueprint of trajectory management systems.",

            "abstract": "Organizations and individuals nowadays are more and more willing to outsource their data to save storage and management costs, especially with the push of cloud computing which offers both storage and computation scalability. However, the data, once being released to a server, is no longer under its owner's control, and its privacy and security herein become a primary concern. To this end, users usually encrypt the private data before outsourcing it, which however makes cloud data mining be very thorny and challenging as data is both big and encrypted. Under such new circumstance, we consider secure scalar product in this paper, which is a building block of data mining used to compute the sum of the products of corresponding values of two vectors. Existing methods either prevent privacy violation in the price of sacrificing accuracy, or requires users to take huge overhead. So, we propose a protocol called Secure Scalar Product in MapReduce (S2PM), which is able to perform massive data processing for encrypted big-data securely. S2PM lets the cloud be responsible for most of the operations while user only need to carry out a decryption operation to get the final result. We formally proved that S2PM can return the correct result and is secure. We also conducted performance analysis for S2PM.",

In terms of features, all offer to store and manage large volumes of data, and all provide some degree of query processing capabilities on top of such data. Our evaluation is based on a micro-benchmark that utilizes a synthetic application that has a social network flavor. We analyze the performance results and discuss the lessons learned from this effort. We hope that this study will inspire future domain-centric evaluations of BDMSs with a focus on their features.",

            "abstract": "Abstract After the establishment of the European Union's Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS) carbon pricing attracted many researchers. This paper aims to develop a prediction model that anticipates future carbon prices given a real-world data set. We treat the carbon pricing issue as part of big data analytics to achieve this goal. We apply three fundamental methodologies to characterize the carbon price. First method is the artificial neural network, which mimics the principle of human brain to process relevant data. As a second approach, we apply the decision tree algorithm. This algorithm is structured through making multiple binary decisions, and it is mostly used for classification. We employ two different decision tree algorithms, namely traditional and conditional, to determine the type of decision tree that gives better results in terms of prediction. Finally, we exploit the random forest, which is a more complex algorithm compared to the decision tree. Similar to the decision tree, we test both traditional and conditional random forest algorithms to analyze their performances. We use Brent crude futures, coal, electricity and natural gas prices, and DAX and S&P Clean Energy Index as explanatory variables. We analyze the variables' effects on carbon price forecasting. According to our results, S&P Clean Energy Index is the most influential variable in explaining the changes in carbon price, followed by DAX Index and coal price. Moreover, we conclude that the traditional random forest is the best algorithm based on all indicators. We provide the details of these methods and their comparisons.

Knowledge discovery and decision\u2010making from such rapidly growing voluminous data are a challenging task in terms of data organization and processing, which is an emerging trend known as big data computing, a new paradigm that combines large\u2010scale compute, new data\u2010intensive techniques, and mathematical models to build data analytics. Big data computing demands a huge storage and computing for data curation and processing that could be delivered from on\u2010premise or clouds infrastructures. This paper discusses the evolution of big data computing, differences between traditional data warehousing and big data, taxonomy of big data computing and underpinning technologies, integrated platform of big data and clouds known as big data clouds, layered architecture and components of big data cloud, and finally open\u2010technical challenges and future directions.

            "abstract": "The growing need of computation and processing has led to the generation of data centers. These data centers are usually comprised of hundreds of thousands of servers and other components. This complicated arrangement of the systems lead to the adoption of complex systems. Complex systems prevail in our society as combination of lots of entities, e.g., immune system, human brain and ecosystems. The adoption and interaction of the entities is possible through nonlinear interactions. The interaction between the components of the complex system is carried out in distributed fashion. Big data which is comprised of thousands of machines is also considered to be a form of complex adaptive systems which makes use of large entities, components and nonlinear interactions with each other. The development of such a complex systems raises certain challenges. Apart from management, energy is the most concerned one which is the core discussion of this research. This paper, surveys the state of the art on modern tools, techniques, architectures and algorithms which has been proposed and deployed to achieve energy efficiency in big data over the period of 2007\u20132015. We group existing approaches aimed at achieving energy efficiency in the complex paradigm of big data. In this categorization, we aim to provide an easy and concise view of the underlined model adapted by each approach in the context of big data.",

It is difficult to find abnormal and exceptional risks only by sampling analysis and static analysis. Exploring the organic integration and business processing methods between big data and bank internal audit, Internal audit work can protect the stable and sustainable development of banks under the new situation. Therefore, based on fuzzy set theory, this paper determines the membership degree of audit data through membership function, and judges the risk level of audit data, and builds a risk level evaluation system. The main features of this paper are as follows. First, it analyzes the necessity of transformation of the bank auditing in the big data environment. The second is to combine the determination of the membership function in the fuzzy set theory with the bank audit analysis, and use the model to calculate the corresponding parameters, thus establishing a risk level assessment system. The third is to propose audit risk assessment recommendations, hoping to help bank audit risk management in the big data environment. There are some shortcomings in this paper. First, the amount of data acquired is not large enough. Second, due to the lack of author\u2019 knowledge, there are still some deficiencies in the analysis of audit risk of commercial banks.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents an approach to solving the data variety problem of big data through an offline and online decisionmaking system. We present a graph-based approach to imitate real-world problem domain with a set of criteria and problem solvers. We introduce a Multi-criteria decision-making model to select a set of problem solvers that meets the set of criteria most. Suppose a system is processing Twitter data that comes as a stream of JSON records from multiple data sources. The decision system determines which of the available methods to use for a list of requirements (criteria). When multiple criteria (must meet requirements) coexist in a problem domain, their order of importance against the criteria, the mutual influence on each other and level of indispensability forms a graphic structure. In the proposed model, we consider each vertex of the graph as a criterion or benefit of an agent against the criterion. The mutual influence of multiple agents is denoted by the connecting edges of the graph. We also proposed a fuzzy graph framework to model real-world unpredictability. The model produces benchmarking results for each of the problem solvers in terms of absolute values to support decision making. The model is implemented through TopBread, Resource Description Framework (RDF), and RDF Data Query Language (RDQL). The key advantage of the proposed model over the existing ones is that the framework can operate in a dual-mode\u2014both as a standalone offline tool and as an online decision-making gateway, it can also be used in high-velocity ingestion scenarios.",

            "abstract": "The papers in this special section focus on Big Data infrastructure. Data is becoming an increasingly decisive resource in modern societies, economies, and governmental organizations. Big Data is an emerging paradigm encompassing various kinds of complex and large scale information beyond the processing capability of conventional software and databases. Various technologies are being discussed to support the handling of big data such as massively parallel processing databases, scalable storage systems, cloud computing platforms, Hadoop and Spark. Due to the multisource, massive, heterogeneous, and dynamic characteristics of application data involved in a distributed environment, one of the most important characteristics of Big Data is to carry out computing on the petabyte (PB), even the exabyte (EB)-level data with a complex computing process. Therefore, large-scale scalable Big Data Infrastructure with corresponding programming language support and software models for efficient processing in distributed environments such as cloud is on demand. In this special issue, we invite articles on innovative research to address challenges of Big Data Infrastructure with emerging computing platforms such as heterogeneous clouds, hybrid architectures, Hadoop or Spark with emphasis on addressing real-time requirements imposed by emerging Big Data applications such as sensing data, e-commerce data, business transactions and web logs, and etc.",

            "abstract": "In the realm of smart cities, telecommunication companies (telcos) are expected to play a protagonistic role as these can capture a variety of natural phenomena on an ongoing basis, e.g., traffic in a city, mobility patterns for emergency response or city planning. The key challenges for telcos in this era is to ingest in the most compact manner huge amounts of network logs, perform big data exploration and analytics on the generated data within a tolerable elapsed time. This paper introduces SPATE, an innovative telco big data exploration framework whose objectives are two-fold: (i) minimizing the storage space needed to incrementally retain data over time, and (ii) minimizing the response time for spatiotemporal data exploration queries over recent data. The storage layer of our framework uses lossless data compression to ingest recent streams of telco big data in the most compact manner retaining full resolution for data exploration tasks. The indexing layer of our system then takes care of the progressive loss of detail in information, coined decaying, as data ages with time. The exploration layer provides visual means to explore the generated spatio-temporal information space. We measure the efficiency of the proposed framework using a 5GB anonymized real telco network trace and a variety of telco-specific tasks, such as OLAP and OLTP querying, privacy-aware data sharing, multivariate statistics, clustering and regression. We show that out framework can achieve comparable response times to the state-of-the-art using an order of magnitude less storage space.",

            "abstract": "The storage of large amounts of digital data, as well as the processing of digital images, are currently expanding significantly across a range of application areas. As a result, effective management of big images databases is necessary, which calls for the employment of automated and cutting-edge indexing techniques. One method used for this is Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR), which tries to index and query the picture database using visual aspects of the image rather than its semantic features. In this article, we propose to explore a digital search engine for similar images, based on multiple image representations and clustering, improved by game theory and machine learning methods.",

            "abstract": "We present CaosDB, a Research Data Management System (RDMS) designed to ensure seamless integration of inhomogeneous data sources and repositories of legacy data in a FAIR way. Its primary purpose is the management of data from biomedical sciences, both from simulations and experiments during the complete research data lifecycle. An RDMS for this domain faces particular challenges: research data arise in huge amounts, from a wide variety of sources, and traverse a highly branched path of further processing. To be accepted by its users, an RDMS must be built around workflows of the scientists and practices and thus support changes in workflow and data structure. Nevertheless, it should encourage and support the development and observation of standards and furthermore facilitate the automation of data acquisition and processing with specialized software. The storage data model of an RDMS must reflect these complexities with appropriate semantics and ontologies while offering simple methods for finding, retrieving, and understanding relevant data. We show how CaosDB responds to these challenges and give an overview of its data model, the CaosDB Server and its easy-to-learn CaosDB Query Language. We briefly discuss the status of the implementation, how we currently use CaosDB, and how we plan to use and extend it.",

            "abstract": "Despite the intense interest towards realizing the Semantic Web vision, most existing RDF data management schemes are constrained in terms of efficiency and scalability. Still, the growing popularity of the RDF format arguably calls for an effort to offset these drawbacks. Viewed from a relational-database perspective, these constraints are derived from the very nature of the RDF data model, which is based on a triple format. Recent research has attempted to address these constraints using a vertical-partitioning approach, in which separate two-column tables are constructed for each property. However, as we show, this approach suffers from similar scalability drawbacks on queries that are not bound by RDF property value. In this paper, we propose an RDF storage scheme that uses the triple nature of RDF as an asset. This scheme enhances the vertical partitioning idea and takes it to its logical conclusion. RDF data is indexed in six possible ways, one for each possible ordering of the three RDF elements. Each instance of an RDF element is associated with two vectors; each such vector gathers elements of one of the other types, along with lists of the third-type resources attached to each vector element. Hence, a sextuple-indexing scheme emerges. This format allows for quick and scalable general-purpose query processing; it confers significant advantages (up to five orders of magnitude) compared to previous approaches for RDF data management, at the price of a worst-case five-fold increase in index space. We experimentally document the advantages of our approach on real-world and synthetic data sets with practical queries.",

            "abstract": "Big Data refers to the large size chunks of data that traditional computing approaches can handle. Despite the truth of having huge cloud systems to manage this data nowadays, there are many challenges related to performing the tasks in the cloud within the expected timeframe using the minimum number of resources possible. The necessity to fulfil user requirements is the main reason of having studies for optimizing the cloud computing of big data in terms of latency, bandwidth, execution time and resource utilization. Therefore, we proposed an efficient task scheduling technique capable to manage big data processing and storage in the cloud in an efficient way that meets user expectations. We provide a solution that involves multiple number of metrics necessary to optimize the solution of big data cloud computing. Our designed model consists of multiple control nodes that control the work done on multiple compute nodes. We used a load balancing algorithm to manage task scheduling on the compute nodes so we make sure that all nodes have equal balance of loads at all times. We simulate different scenarios to prove the concept of the study including latency, task execution time, bandwidth and resource utilization. This study achieved 31.4% as an average decrease percentage in task execution time and this has led to 11.36% utilization of resources.",

            "abstract": "Lately, acquiring a large quantity of three-dimensional (3-D) spatial data particularly topographic information has become commonplace with the advent of new technology such as laser scanner or light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and techniques. Though both in the USA and around the globe, the pace of massive 3-D spatial data collection is accelerating, the provision of affordable technology for dealing with issues such as processing, management, archival, dissemination, and analysis of the huge data volumes has lagged behind. Single computers and generic high-end computing are not sufficient to process this massive data and researches started to explore other computing environments. Recently cloud computing environment showed very promising solutions due to availability and affordability. The main goal of this paper is to develop a web-based LiDAR data processing framework called \"Cloud Computing-based LiDAR Processing System (CLiPS)\" to process massive LiDAR data using cloud computing environment. The CLiPS framework implementation was done using ESRI's ArcGIS server, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), and several open source spatial tools. Some of the applications developed in this project include: 1) preprocessing tools for LiDAR data, 2) generation of large area Digital Elevation Model (DEMs) on the cloud environment, and 3) user-driven DEM derived products. We have used three different terrain types, LiDAR tile sizes, and EC2 instant types (large, Xlarge, and double Xlarge) to test for time and cost comparisons. Undulating terrain data took more time than other two terrain types used in this study and overall cost for the entire project was less than $100.",

There are many domains, such as genomics, geological data and daily twitter feeds where the datasets of interest are 5TB to 20 TB. For such a dataset, one would need a cluster with 100 servers, each with 128GB to 256GBs of DRAM, to accommodate all the data in DRAM. On the other hand, such datasets could be stored easily in the flash memory of a rack-sized cluster. Flash storage has much better random access performance than hard disks, which makes it desirable for analytics workloads. In this paper we present BlueDBM, a new system architecture which has flash-based storage with in-store processing capability and a low-latency high-throughput inter-controller network. We show that BlueDBM outperforms a flash-based system without these features by a factor of 10 for some important applications. While the performance of a ram-cloud system falls sharply even if only 5%~10% of the references are to the secondary storage, this sharp performance degradation is not an issue in BlueDBM. BlueDBM presents an attractive point in the cost-performance trade-off for Big Data analytics.",

            "abstract": "DATA is becoming an increasingly decisive resource in modern societies, economies, and governmental organizations. Big Data is an emerging paradigm encompassing various kinds of complex and large scale information beyond the processing capability of conventional software and databases. Various technologies are being discussed to support the handling of big data such as massively parallel processing databases, scalable storage systems, cloud computing platforms, Hadoop and Spark. Due to the multisource, massive, heterogeneous, and dynamic characteristics of application data involved in a distributed environment, one of the most important characteristics of Big Data is to carry out computing on the petabyte (PB), even the exabyte (EB)-level data with a complex computing process. Therefore, large-scale scalable Big Data Infrastructure with corresponding programming language support and software models for efficient processing in distributed environments such as cloud is on demand. In this special issue, we invite articles on innovative research to address challenges of Big Data Infrastructure with emerging computing platforms such as heterogeneous clouds, hybrid architectures, Hadoop or Spark with emphasis on addressing real-time requirements imposed by emerging Big Data applications such as sensing data, e-commerce data, business transactions and web logs, and etc. It is a great honor of the editorial team to have more than 80 research groups share their latest research works and solutions to these challenges. The SI attracted a large number of submissions from North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia. Our Guest Editor (GE) team accepted 21 papers that cover multiple aspects of Big Data Infrastructure. We hope that this SI will serve as a good reference for engineers, scientists, researchers, and academics in the field of Big Data. We grouped the accepted papers into two editorials: Big Data Infrastructure I and II. This is the editorial for Big Data Infrastructure II. In the SI, the first paper titled \u201cStructural Balance Theory-Based E-Commerce Recommendation over Big Rating Data\u201d presents a Structural Balance Theory-based Recommendation (i.e., SBT-Rec) approach. In the second paper titled \u201cCloud Infrastructure Resource Allocation for Big Data Applications\u201d, the authors present a multi-objective optimization algorithm to trade off the performance, availability, and cost of Big Data application running on Cloud. In the third paper titled \u201cA Big Data-as-a-Service Framework: State-of-the-Art and Perspectives\u201d, the authors aim to review the current state-of-the-art of Big Data from the aspects of organization and representation, cleaning and reduction, integration and processing, security and privacy, analytics and applications, then present a novel framework to provide high-quality so called Big Data-as-aService. The fourth paper is titled as \u201cA Secure and Verifiable Access Control Scheme for Big Data Storage in Clouds\u201d, which presents a secure and verifiable access control scheme based on the NTRU cryptosystem for big data storage in clouds. In the fifth paper titled \u201cSDN-Based Big Data Caching in ISP Networks\u201d, the authors propose an SDN-based Cooperative Cache Network (SCCN) for ISP networks, aiming to minimize the content transmission latency while reducing the inter-ISP traffic. The sixth paper titled \u201cQuantCloud: Big Data Infrastructure for Quantitative Finance on the Clouds\u201d presents the QuantCloud infrastructure, which is designed for performing big data analytics in modern quantitative finance. In the Seventh paper titled \u201cNGD: Filtering Graphs for Visual Analysis\u201d, the authors extend the concept of a node degree to a node global degree for a node in a graph, and present an algorithm that computes their scores of all nodes. In the eighth paper titled \u201cAccelerating MapReduce on Commodity Clusters: An SSD-Empowered Approach\u201d, the authors present mpCache, a solution that utilizes solid-state drive (SSD) to cache input data and localized data of MapReduce tasks. In the ninth paper titled \u201cBig Data Analysis-Based Security Situational Awareness for Smart Grid\u201d, the authors propose proposes a security situational awareness mechanism based on the analysis of big data in the smart grid. The tenth paper tiled \u201cMtMR: Ensuring MapReduce Computation Integrity with Merkle Tree-Based Verifications\u201d introduces tMtMR, a Merkle tree-based verification method that assures high result integrity of MapReduce jobs. MtMR overlays MapReduce on a hybrid cloud environment and applies two rounds of Merkle tree-based verifications on the prereduce phase (i.e., the map phase and the shuffle phase) and the reduce phase, respectively. We would like to thank all the authors for their contributions and the reviewers for their great effort in the SI review process. We would especially like to thank the Editorin-Chief, Prof. Qiang Yang for allowing our GE team to have the opportunity to publish this SI and his great support.

Fog computing reduces latency and increases throughput by processing data near the body sensor network. In this paper, we proposed a secure service-orientated edge computing architecture that is validated on recently released public dataset. Results and discussions support the applicability of proposed architecture for smart health applications. We proposed SoA-Fog i.e. a three-tier secure framework for efficient management of health data using fog devices. It discuss the security aspects in client layer, fog layer and the cloud layer. We design the prototype by using win-win spiral model with use case and sequence diagram. Overlay analysis was performed using proposed framework on malaria vector borne disease positive maps of Maharastra state in India from 2011 to 2014. The mobile clients were taken as test case. We performed comparative analysis between proposed secure fog framework and state-of-the art cloud-based framework.",

Examples include web analytics applications, scientific applications, and social networks. A popular data processing engine for big data is Hadoop MapReduce. Early versions of Hadoop MapReduce suffered from severe performance problems. Today, this is becoming history. There are many techniques that can be used with Hadoop MapReduce jobs to boost performance by orders of magnitude. In this tutorial we teach such techniques. First, we will briefly familiarize the audience with Hadoop MapReduce and motivate its use for big data processing. Then, we will focus on different data management techniques, going from job optimization to physical data organization like data layouts and indexes. Throughout this tutorial, we will highlight the similarities and differences between Hadoop MapReduce and Parallel DBMS. Furthermore, we will point out unresolved research problems and open issues.",

            "abstract": "Big Data analytics has become an invaluable tool in a wide variety of businesses for exploiting the wealth of Big Data that they now have access to. As a result, various solutions within different categories of Big Data systems are emerging to meet their needs. In this paper we use the TPC-H benchmark to compare the performance of four Big Data systems picked from the major categories of Big Data platforms: a commercial parallel relational database (from the traditional DBMS world), Hive and Spark SQL (from the SQL-on-Hadoop world), and AsterixDB (from the world of NoSQL systems). All of these systems have sufficiently rich query APIs and runtime systems to run TPC-H in its full form. On the other hand, the systems also have major differences in terms of their architectures, preferred storage formats, support for complex schema definitions, and approaches to query processing. This makes them a very interesting set of representative Big Data systems to compare. We present the results that we obtained through running these systems at different TPC-H scales using various settings, and we analyze a selected set of interesting query results in more detail to explore the trade-offs between performance, storage formats, and schema definitions. A follow-up discussion is included as well to summarize the lessons learned from this effort.",

            "abstract": "Data is increasingly affecting the automotive industry, from vehicle development, to manufacturing and service processes, to online services centered around the connected vehicle. Connected, mobile and Internet of Things devices and machines generate immense amounts of sensor data. The ability to process and analyze this data to extract insights and knowledge that enable intelligent services, new ways to understand business problems, improvements of processes and decisions, is a critical capability. Hadoop is a scalable platform for compute and storage and emerged as de-facto standard for Big Data processing at Internet companies and in the scientific community. However, there is a lack of understanding of how and for what use cases these new Hadoop capabilities can be efficiently used to augment automotive applications and systems. This paper surveys use cases and applications for deploying Hadoop in the automotive industry. Over the years a rich ecosystem emerged around Hadoop comprising tools for parallel, in-memory and stream processing (most notable MapReduce and Spark), SQL and NOSQL engines (Hive, HBase), and machine learning (Mahout, MLlib). It is critical to develop an understanding of automotive applications and their characteristics and requirements for data discovery, integration, exploration and analytics. We then map these requirements to a confined technical architecture consisting of core Hadoop services and libraries for data ingest, processing and analytics. The objective of this paper is to address questions, such as: What applications and datasets are suitable for Hadoop? How can a diverse set of frameworks and tools be managed on multi-tenant Hadoop cluster? How do these tools integrate with existing relational data management systems? How can enterprise security requirements be addressed? What are the performance characteristics of these tools for real-world automotive applications? To address the last question, we utilize a standard benchmark (TPCx-HS), and two application benchmarks (SQL and machine learning) that operate on a dataset of multiple Terabytes and billions of rows.",

            "title": "Spark SQL: Relational Data Processing in Spark",
            "abstract": "Spark SQL is a new module in Apache Spark that integrates relational processing with Spark's functional programming API. Built on our experience with Shark, Spark SQL lets Spark programmers leverage the benefits of relational processing (e.g. declarative queries and optimized storage), and lets SQL users call complex analytics libraries in Spark (e.g. machine learning). Compared to previous systems, Spark SQL makes two main additions. First, it offers much tighter integration between relational and procedural processing, through a declarative DataFrame API that integrates with procedural Spark code. Second, it includes a highly extensible optimizer, Catalyst, built using features of the Scala programming language, that makes it easy to add composable rules, control code generation, and define extension points. Using Catalyst, we have built a variety of features (e.g. schema inference for JSON, machine learning types, and query federation to external databases) tailored for the complex needs of modern data analysis. We see Spark SQL as an evolution of both SQL-on-Spark and of Spark itself, offering richer APIs and optimizations while keeping the benefits of the Spark programming model.",
