            "abstract": "We observe that the recent advances in big data computing have empowered model-based services such as speech recognition, face recognition, context-aware service, and many other services. Various sources of user's logs can be utilized in remodeling or adapting existing models to improve the quality of service. We propose a system that can support store/retrieve data and process them in a scalable manner. Recently advances in ASR and big data technologies drive more personalized services in many areas of services. A speaker adaptation is one good example which requires huge computation cost in creating a personalized acoustic model and corresponding language model over 100s millions of Samsung product users. We propose a personalized and scalable ASR system powered by the big data infrastructure which brings data-driven personalized opportunities to voice-enabled services such as voice-to-text transcriber, voice-enabled web search in a peta bytes scale. We verify the feasibility of speaker adaptation based on 107 testers' recordings and obtain about 10% of recognition accuracy. We study an optimal set of execution environments by executing jobs running either on Hadoop 1 or Hadoop 2 cluster, and move forward performance optimization strategies: workflow compaction, file compression, best file system selection among several distributed file systems. We devise a metric for the cost of personalized model creation to compare the efficiency of one cluster with the other cluster, and it provides the estimated total execution time for the given number of machines. We finally introduce our in-house object storage and data storage design, and their high performance compared to state-of-the art systems, optimized for voice-enabled services to effectively support small and large files.",

            "abstract": "A large number of continual range queries can be issued against a data stream. Usually, a main memory-based query index with a small storage cost and a fast search time is needed, especially if the stream is rapid. In this paper, we present a CEI-based query index that meets both criteria for efficient processing of continual interval queries in a streaming environment. This new query index is centered around a set of predefined virtual <i>containment-encoded intervals</i>, or CEIs. The CEIs are used to first decompose query intervals and then perform efficient search operations. The CEIs are defined and labeled such that containment relationships among them are encoded in their IDs. The containment encoding makes decomposition and search operations efficient because integer additions and logical shifts can be used to carry out most of the operations. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the CEI-based query index and to compare it with alternative approaches. The results show that the CEI-based query index significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of both storage cost and search time.",

            "abstract": "Many advanced data management operations (e.g., incremental maintenance, trust assessment, debugging schema mappings, keyword search over databases, or query answering in probabilistic databases), involve computations that look at how a tuple was produced, e.g., to determine its score or existence. This requires answers to queries such as, \"Is this data derivable from trusted tuples?\"; \"What tuples are derived from this relation?\"; or \"What score should this answer receive, given initial scores of the base tuples?\". Such questions can be answered by consulting the provenance of query results. In recent years there has been significant progress on formal models for provenance. However, the issues of provenance storage, maintenance, and querying have not yet been addressed in an application-independent way. In this paper, we adopt the most general formalism for tuple-based provenance, semiring provenance. We develop a query language for provenance, which can express all of the aforementioned types of queries, as well as many more; we propose storage, processing and indexing schemes for data provenance in support of these queries; and we experimentally validate the feasibility of provenance querying and the benefits of our indexing techniques across a variety of application classes and queries.",

            "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of sensors and mobile devices has led to an explosive increase of the scale of spatio-temporal data in the form of trajectories. A trajectory aggregate query, as a fundamental functionality for measuring trajectory data, aims to retrieve the statistics of trajectories passing a user-specified spatio-temporal region. A large-scale spatio-temporal database with big disk-resident data takes very long time to produce exact answers to such queries. Hence, approximate query processing with a guaranteed error bound is a promising solution in many scenarios with stringent response-time requirements. In this paper, we study the problem of approximate query processing for trajectory aggregate queries. We show that it boils down to the distinct value estimation problem, which has been proven to be very hard with powerful negative results given that no index is built. By utilizing the well-established spatio-temporal index and introducing an inverted index to trajectory data, we are able to design random index sampling (RIS) algorithm to estimate the answers with a guaranteed error bound. To further improve system scalability, we extend RIS algorithm to concurrent random index sampling (CRIS) algorithm to process a number of trajectory aggregate queries arriving concurrently with overlapping spatio-temporal query regions. To demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our sampling and estimation methods, we applied them in a real large-scale user trajectory database collected from a cellular service provider in China. Our extensive evaluation results indicate that both RIS and CRIS outperform exhaustive search for single and concurrent trajectory aggregate queries by two orders of magnitude in terms of the query processing time, while preserving a relative error ratio lower than 10\\%, with only 1% search cost of the exhaustive search method.",

With its dramatic adoption and its ability to model structured, unstructured and semi-structured data, XML has the potential of becoming the data model for Internet data. In recent years, Oracle has evolved its DBMS to support complex, structured, and un-structured data. Oracle has now extended that technology to enable the storage and querying of XML data by evolving its DBMS to an XML enabled DBMS, Oracle8i. We present Oracle's XML-enabling database technology. In particular, we discuss how XML data can be stored, managed and queried in the Oracle8i database.",

            "abstract": "The idea of collecting and combining large public data sets and services became more and more popular. The special characteristics of such systems and the requirements of the participants demand for strictly decentralized solutions. However, this comes along with several ambitious challenges a corresponding system has to overcome. In this demonstration paper, we present a lightweight distributed universal storage capable of dealing with those challenges, and providing a powerful and flexible way of building Internet-scale public data management systems. We introduce our approach based on a triple storage on top of a distributed hash table (DHT) overlay system, based on the ideas of a universal relation model and the resource description framework (RDF), and outline solved challenges as well as open issues.",

            "abstract": "Proliferation of structural, semi-structural and no-structural data, has challenged the scalability, flexibility and processability of the traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS). The next generation systems demand horizontal scaling by distributing data over autonomously addable nodes to a running system. For schema flexibility, they also want to process and store different data formats along the sequence factor in the data. NoSQL approaches are solutions to these, hence big data solutions are vital nowadays. But in monitoring scenarios sensors transmit the data continuously over certain intervals of time and temporal factor is the main property of the data. Therefore the key research aspect is to investigate schema flexibility and temporal data integration aspects together. We need to know that: what data modelling should we adopt for a data driven real-time scenario; that we could store the data effectively and evolve the schema accordingly during data integration in NoSQL environments without losing big data advantages. In this paper we explain a middleware based schema model to support the temporal oriented storage of real-time data of ANT+ sensors as hierarchical documents. We explain how to adopt a schema for the data integration by using an algorithm based approach for flexible evolution of the model for a document oriented database, i.e, MongoDB. The proposed model is logical, compact for storage and evolves seamlessly upon new data integration.",

            "abstract": "The competent software architecture plays a crucial role in the difficult task of big data processing for SQL and NoSQL databases. SQL databases were created to organize data and allow for horizontal expansion. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, support horizontal scalability and can efficiently process large amounts of unstructured data. Organizational needs determine which paradigm is appropriate, yet selecting the best option is not always easy. Differences in database design are what set SQL and NoSQL databases apart. Each NoSQL database type also consistently employs a mixed-model approach. Therefore, it is challenging for cloud users to transfer their data among different cloud storage services (CSPs). There are several different paradigms being monitored by the various cloud platforms (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and DBaaS). The purpose of this SLR is to examine the articles that address cloud data portability and interoperability, as well as the software architectures of SQL and NoSQL databases. Numerous studies comparing the capabilities of SQL and NoSQL of databases, particularly Oracle RDBMS and NoSQL Document Database (MongoDB), in terms of scale, performance, availability, consistency, and sharding, were presented as part of the state of the art. Research indicates that NoSQL databases, with their specifically tailored structures, may be the best option for big data analytics, while SQL databases are best suited for online transaction processing (OLTP) purposes.",

            "abstract": "Management of graph structured data has important applications in several areas. Queries on such data sets are based on structural properties of the graphs, in addition to values of attributes. Answering such queries pose significant challenges, as reasoning about structural properties across graphs are typically intractable problems. This chapter provides an overview of the challenges in designing databases over graph datasets. Different application areas that use graph databases, pose their own unique set of challenges, making the task of designing a generic graphoriented DBMS still an elusive goal. The purpose of this chapter is to survey some of the piecemeal solutions that have been proposed to address specific challenges in graph data management and suggest an overall structure in which these different solutions can be meaningfully placed.",

            "abstract": "Despite the importance and widespread use of range data, e.g., time intervals, spatial ranges, etc., little attention has been devoted to study the processing and querying of range data in the context of big data. The main challenge relies in the nature of the traditional index structures e.g., B-Tree and R-Tree, being centralized by nature, and hence are almost crippled when deployed in a distributed environment. To address this challenge, this paper presents Kangaroo, a system built on top of Hadoop to optimize the execution of range queries over range data. The main idea behind Kangaroo is to split the data into non-overlapping partitions in a way that minimizes the query execution time. Kangaroo is query workload-aware, i.e., results in partitioning layouts that minimize the query processing time of given query patterns. In this paper, we study the design challenges Kangaroo addresses in order to be deployed on top of a distributed file system, i.e., HDFS. We also study four different partitioning schemes that Kangaroo can support. With extensive experiments using real range data of more than one billion records and real query workload of more than 30,000 queries, we show that the partitioning schemes of Kangaroo can significantly reduce the I/O of range queries on range data.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT In this systems paper, we present MillenniumDB: a novel graph database engine that is modular, persistent, and open source. MillenniumDB is based on a graph data model, which we call domain graphs, that provides a simple abstraction upon which a variety of popular graph models can be supported, thus providing a flexible data management engine for diverse types of knowledge graph. The engine itself is founded on a combination of tried and tested techniques from relational data management, state-of-the-art algorithms for worst-case-optimal joins, as well as graph-specific algorithms for evaluating path queries. In this paper, we present the main design principles underlying MillenniumDB, describing the abstract graph model and query semantics supported, the concrete data model and query syntax implemented, as well as the storage, indexing, query planning and query evaluation techniques used. We evaluate MillenniumDB over real-world data and queries from the Wikidata knowledge graph, where we find that it outperforms other popular persistent graph database engines (including both enterprise and open source alternatives) that support similar query features.",

            "abstract": "Big social data have enabled new opportunities for evaluating the applicability of social science theories that were formulated decades ago and were often based on small- to medium-sized samples. Big Data coupled with powerful computing has the potential to replace the statistical practice of sampling and estimating effects by measuring phenomena based on full populations. Preparing these data for analysis and conducting analytics involves a plethora of decisions, some of which are already embedded in previously collected data and built tools. These decisions refer to the recording, indexing and representation of data and the settings for analysis methods. While these choices can have tremendous impact on research outcomes, they are not often obvious, not considered or not being made explicit. Consequently, our awareness and understanding of the impact of these decisions on analysis results and derived implications are highly underdeveloped. This might be attributable to occasional high levels of over-confidence in computational solutions as well as the possible yet questionable assumption that Big Data can wash out minor data quality issues, among other reasons. This article provides examples for how to address this issue. It argues that checking, ensuring and validating the quality of big social data and related auxiliary material is a key ingredient for empowering users to gain reliable insights from their work. Scrutinizing data for accuracy issues, systematically fixing them and diligently documenting these processes can have another positive side effect: Closely interacting with the data, thereby forcing ourselves to understand their idiosyncrasies and patterns, can help us to move from being able to precisely model and formally describe effects in society to also understand and explain them.",

            "abstract": "Similarity query (a.k.a. nearest neighbor query) processing has been an active research topic for several decades. It is an essential procedure in a wide range of applications (e.g., classification & regression, deduplication, image retrieval, and recommender systems). Recently, representation learning and auto-encoding methods as well as pre-trained models have gained popularity. They basically deal with dense high-dimensional data, and this trend brings new opportunities and challenges to similarity query processing. Meanwhile, new techniques have emerged to tackle this long-standing problem theoretically and empirically. This tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive review of high-dimensional similarity query processing for data science. It introduces solutions from a variety of research communities, including data mining (DM), database (DB), machine learning (ML), computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), and theoretical computer science (TCS), thereby highlighting the interplay between modern computer science and artificial intelligence technologies. We first discuss the importance of high-dimensional similarity query processing in data science applications, and then review query processing algorithms such as cover tree, locality sensitive hashing, product quantization, proximity graphs, as well as recent advancements such as learned indexes. We analyze their strengths and weaknesses and discuss the selection of algorithms in various application scenarios. Moreover, we consider the selectivity estimation of high-dimensional similarity queries, and show how researchers are bringing in state-of-the-art ML techniques to address this problem. We expect that this tutorial will provide an impetus towards new technologies for data science.",

            "abstract": "The blooming of different cloud data stores has turned polystore systems to a major topic in the nowadays cloud landscape. Especially, as the amount of processed data grows rapidly each year, much attention is being paid on taking advantage of the parallel processing capabilities of the underlying data stores. To provide data federation, a typical polystore solution defines a common data model and query language with translations to API calls or queries to each data store. However, this may lead to losing important querying capabilities. The polyglot approach of the CloudMdsQL query language allows data store native queries to be expressed as inline scripts and combined with regular SQL statements in ad-hoc integration queries. Moreover, efficient optimization techniques, such as bind join, can still take place to improve the performance of selective joins. In this paper, we introduce the distributed architecture of the LeanXcale query engine that processes polyglot queries in the CloudMdsQL query language, yet allowing native scripts to be handled in parallel at data store shards, so that efficient and scalable parallel joins take place at the query engine level. The experimental evaluation of the LeanXcale parallel query engine on various join queries illustrates well the performance benefits of exploiting the parallelism of the underlying data management technologies in combination with the high expressivity provided by their scripting/querying frameworks.",

            "abstract": "We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of ArrayStore, a new storage manager for complex, parallel array processing. ArrayStore builds on prior work in the area of multidimensional data storage, but considers the new problem of supporting a parallel and more varied workload comprising not only range-queries, but also binary operations such as joins and complex user-defined functions.\n This paper makes two key contributions. First, it examines several existing single-site storage management strategies and array partitioning strategies to identify which combination is best suited for the array-processing workload above. Second, it develops a new and efficient storage-management mechanism that enables parallel processing of operations that must access data from adjacent partitions.\n We evaluate ArrayStore on over 80GB of real data from two scientific domains and real operators used in these domains. We show that ArrayStore outperforms previously proposed storage management strategies in the context of its diverse target workload.",

            "abstract": "With the prevalence of positioning techniques, a prodigious number of spatio-temporal data is generated con-stantly. To effectively support sophisticated urban applications, e.g., location-based services, based on spatio-temporal data, it is desirable for an efficient, scalable, update-enabled, and easy-to-use spatio-temporal data management system.This paper presents JUST, i.e., JD Urban Spatio-Temporal data engine, which can efficiently manage big spatio-temporal data in a convenient way. JUST incorporates the distributed NoSQL data store, i.e., Apache HBase, as the underlying storage, GeoMesa as the spatio-temporal data indexing tool, and Apache Spark as the execution engine. We creatively design two indexing techniques, i.e., Z2T and XZ2T, which accelerates spatio-temporal queries tremendously. Furthermore, we introduce a compression mechanism, which not only greatly reduces the storage cost, but also improves the query efficiency. To make JUST easy-to-use, we design and implement a complete SQL engine, with which all operations can be performed through a SQL-like query language, i.e., JustQL. JUST also supports inherently new data insertions and historical data updates without index reconstruction. JUST is deployed as a PaaS in JD with multi-users support. Many applications have been developed based on the SDKs provided by JUST. Extensive experiments are carried out with six state-of-the-art distributed spatio-temporal data management systems based on two real datasets and one synthetic dataset. The results show that JUST has a competitive query performance and is much more scalable than them.",

            "abstract": "A path query aims to find trajectories passing a given sequence of connected road segments within a time period. It is very useful in many urban applications: 1) traffic modeling, 2) frequent path mining, 3) intersection coordination, and 4) traffic anomaly detection. Existing solutions for path query processing are implemented based on single machines, which are not efficient for the following tasks: 1) indexing large-scale historical data; 2) handling real-time trajectory updates; and 3) processing concurrent path queries from urban data mining applications. In this paper, we design and implement a cloud-based path query processing framework based on Microsoft Azure. We modify existing suffix tree structure to index trajectories using Azure Table. The proposed system consists of two main parts: 1) back-end processing, which performs pre-processing (i.e., parsing and map-matching) and index building tasks with a distributed computing platform (i.e., Storm) used to efficiently handle massive real-time trajectory updates; and 2) query processing, which answers path queries using Azure Storm to improve efficiency and overcome I/O bottleneck. Extensive experiments are performed based on the real-time taxi trajectories from Guiyang City, the capital of Guizhou Province, China to confirm the system efficiency. We also demonstrate a real deployed traffic analysis system based on our query processing framework.",

            "abstract": "To achieve high reliability and scalability, most large-scale data warehouse systems have adopted the cluster-based architecture. In this paper, we propose the design of a new cluster-based data warehouse system, LLama, a hybrid data management system which combines the features of row-wise and column-wise database systems. In Llama, columns are formed into correlation groups to provide the basis for the vertical partitioning of tables. Llama employs a distributed file system (DFS) to disseminate data among cluster nodes. Above the DFS, a MapReduce-based query engine is supported. We design a new join algorithm to facilitate fast join processing. We present a performance study on TPC-H dataset and compare Llama with Hive, a data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Hadoop. The experiment is conducted on EC2. The results show that Llama has an excellent load performance and its query performance is significantly better than the traditional MapReduce framework based on row-wise storage.",

            "abstract": "Blockchain has emerged as a promising solution for secure data storage and retrieval for decentralized applications. To scale blockchain systems, a prevailing approach is to employ a hybrid storage model, where only small meta-data are stored on-chain while the raw data are outsourced to an off-chain storage service provider. The key issue for query processing in such a system is the design of gas-efficient authenticated data structure (ADS) to authenticate the query results. In this paper, we study novel ADS schemes for authenticated keyword search in hybrid-storage blockchains. We first propose the Suppressed Merkle inverted (Merkleinv) index, which maintains only a partial ADS structure on-chain that can be securely updated with a logarithm-sized cryptographic proof. Moreover, we propose a Chameleon inverted (Chameleoninv) index that leverages the chameleon vector commitment to achieve a constant maintenance cost. It is further optimized with Bloom filters to enhance the query and verification performance. We prove the security of the proposed ADS schemes and evaluate their performance using real datasets on the Ethereum platform. Experimental results show that, compared to a baseline solution, the proposed Merkleinv and Chameleoninv indexes reduce the average on-chain maintenance cost from US$10.39 down to US$2.50 and US$0.24, respectively, without sacrificing much the query performance.",

            "abstract": "The effectiveness of content-based image retrieval can be enhanced using heterogeneous features embedded in the images. However, since the features in texture, color, and shape are generated using different computation methods and thus may require different similarity measurements, the integration of the retrievals on heterogeneous features is a nontrivial task. We present a semantics-based clustering and indexing approach, termed SemQuery, to support visual queries on heterogeneous features of images. Using this approach, the database images are classified based on their heterogeneous features. Each semantic image cluster contains a set of subclusters that are represented by the heterogeneous features that the images contain. An image is included in a semantic cluster if it falls within the scope of all the heterogeneous clusters of the semantic cluster. We also design a neural network model to merge the results of basic queries on individual features. A query processing strategy is then presented to support visual queries on heterogeneous features. An experimental analysis is conducted and presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.",

            "abstract": "Deep learning has improved state-of-the-art results in many important fields, and has been the subject of much research in recent years, leading to the development of several systems for facilitating deep learning. Current systems, however, mainly focus on model building and training phases, while the issues of data management, model sharing, and lifecycle management are largely ignored. Deep learning modeling lifecycle generates a rich set of data artifacts, e.g., learned parameters and training logs, and it comprises of several frequently conducted tasks, e.g., to understand the model behaviors and to try out new models. Dealing with such artifacts and tasks is cumbersome and largely left to the users. This paper describes our vision and implementation of a data and lifecycle management system for deep learning. First, we generalize model exploration and model enumeration queries from commonly conducted tasks by deep learning modelers, and propose a high-level domain specific language (DSL), inspired by SQL, to raise the abstraction level and thereby accelerate the modeling process. To manage the variety of data artifacts, especially the large amount of checkpointed float parameters, we design a novel model versioning system (dlv), and a read-optimized parameter archival storage system (PAS) that minimizes storage footprint and accelerates query workloads with minimal loss of accuracy. PAS archives versioned models using deltas in a multi-resolution fashion by separately storing the less significant bits, and features a novel progressive query (inference) evaluation algorithm. Third, we develop e cient algorithms for archiving versioned models using deltas under co-retrieval constraints. We conduct extensive experiments over several real datasets from computer vision domain to show the e ciency of the proposed techniques.",

            "abstract": "Providing scalable database services is an essential requirement for extending many existing applications of the Cloud platform. Due to the diversity of applications, database services on the Cloud must support large-scale data analytical jobs and high concurrent OLTP queries. Most existing work focuses on some specific type of applications. To provide an integrated framework, we are designing a new system, epiC, as our solution to next-generation database systems. In epiC, indexes play an important role in improving overall performance. Different types of indexes are built to provide efficient query processing for different applications. In this paper, we propose RT-CAN, a multi-dimensional indexing scheme in epiC. RT-CAN integrates CAN [23] based routing protocol and the R-tree based indexing scheme to support efficient multi-dimensional query processing in a Cloud system. RT-CAN organizes storage and compute nodes into an overlay structure based on an extended CAN protocol. In our proposal, we make a simple assumption that each compute node uses an R-tree like indexing structure to index the data that are locally stored. We propose a query-conscious cost model that selects beneficial local R-tree nodes for publishing. By keeping the number of persistently connected nodes small and maintaining a global multi-dimensional search index, we can locate the compute nodes that may contain the answer with a few hops, making the scheme scalable in terms of data volume and number of compute nodes. Experiments on Amazon's EC2 show that our proposed routing protocol and indexing scheme are robust, efficient and scalable.",

            "abstract": "Traditional databases are not equipped with the adequate functionality to handle the volume and variety of \"Big Data\". Strict schema definition and data loading are prerequisites even for the most primitive query session. Raw data processing has been proposed as a schema-on-demand alternative that provides instant access to the data. When loading is an option, it is driven exclusively by the current-running query, resulting in sub-optimal performance across a query workload. In this paper, we investigate the problem of workload-driven raw data processing with partial loading. We model loading as fully-replicated binary vertical partitioning. We provide a linear mixed integer programming optimization formulation that we prove to be NP-hard. We design a two-stage heuristic that comes within close range of the optimal solution in a fraction of the time. We extend the optimization formulation and the heuristic to pipelined raw data processing, scenario in which data access and extraction are executed concurrently. We provide three case-studies over real data formats that confirm the accuracy of the model when implemented in a state-of-the-art pipelined operator for raw data processing.",

            "abstract": "With the growing number of Open Data initiatives and the increased volume of related data, new forms of civic engagement are emerging. This engagement leads to novel applications and problem solving approaches. Useful insights derived from exploiting publicly available data and open source tools ultimately result in the enhancement of daily life in our communities. In this paper, we analyze publicly available road accident data for the cities of Fredericton and Laval. A traffic accident data processing and analysis pipeline is built using big data systems and big data spatial frameworks. We present a comparative analysis of traffic accidents in these two cities. Random forest classification models are trained to predict if an accident has casualties. The predictive models are used to provide insights into important factors affecting accidents with fatalities or injuries. Results of the study can be used to establish meaningful safe driving policy suggestions, aid in making emergency dispatch decisions, inform accident management procedures or even assist with urban planning.",

            "abstract": "Distributed RDF data management systems become increasingly important with the growth of the Semantic Web. Regardless, current methods meet performance bottlenecks either on data loading or querying when processing large amounts of data. In this work, we propose efficient methods for processing RDF using dynamic data re-partitioning to enable rapid analysis of large datasets. Our approach adopts a two-tier index architecture on each computation node: (1) a lightweight primary index, to keep loading times low, and (2) a series of dynamic, multi-level secondary indexes, calculated as a by-product of query execution, to decrease or remove inter-machine data movement for subsequent queries that contain the same graph patterns. In addition, we propose methods to replace some secondary indexes with distributed filters, so as to decrease memory consumption. Experimental results on a commodity cluster with 16 nodes show that the method presents good scale-out characteristics and can indeed vastly improve loading speeds while remaining competitive in terms of performance. Specifically, our approach can load a dataset of 1.1 billion triples at a rate of 2.48 million triples per second and provide competitive performance to RDF-3X and 4store for expensive queries.",

            "abstract": "With the emergence of cloud computing, many organizations have moved their data to the cloud in order to provide scalable, reliable and high available services. As these services mainly rely on geographically-distributed data replication to guarantee good performance and high availability, consistency comes into question. The CAP theorem discusses tradeoffs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance, and concludes that only two of these three properties can be guaranteed simultaneously in replicated storage systems. With data growing in size and systems growing in scale, new tradeoffs have been introduced and new models are emerging for maintaining data consistency. In this chapter, we discuss the consistency issue and describe the CAP theorem as well as its limitations and impacts on big data management in large scale systems. We then briefly introduce several models of consistency in cloud storage systems. Then, we study some state-of-the-art cloud storage systems from both enterprise and academia, and discuss their contribution to maintaining data consistency. To complete our chapter, we introduce the current trend toward adaptive consistency in big data systems and introduce our dynamic adaptive consistency solution (Harmony). We conclude by discussing the open issues and challenges raised regarding consistency in the cloud.",

            "abstract": "Digital information systems currently generate a vast amount of data every minute which emphasizes the continuing need to advance big data management systems with efficient data ingestion and knowledge extraction capabilities. To address the \u2018big data\u2019 problems due to high volume, velocity, variety, and veracity, data management systems evolved from structured databases to big data storage systems, graph databases, data warehouses, and data lakes but each solution has its strengths and shortcomings. The need to produce actionable knowledge fast from unstructured data ingested from distributed sources requires a marriage of data warehouses and data lakes to create a data Lakehouse (LH). The objective is to use the strengths of the data warehouse in producing insights fast from processed merged data, and of the data lake in ingesting and storing high-speed unstructured data with post-storage transformation and analytics capabilities. In this paper, we present a comparative review of the existing data warehouse and data lake technology to highlight their strengths and weaknesses and propose the desired and necessary features of the LH architecture, which has recently gained a lot of attention in the big data management research community.",

            "abstract": "1. MOTIVATION AND SUMMARY Traditional Database Management Systems (DBMS) software is built on the concept of persistent data sets, that are stored reliably in stable storage and queried/updated several times throughout their lifetime. For several emerging application domains, however, data arrives and needs to be processed on a continuous ( ) basis, without the benefit of several passes over a static, persistent data image. Such continuous data streams arise naturally, for example, in the network installations of large Telecom and Internet service providers where detailed usage information (Call-Detail-Records (CDRs), SNMP/RMON packet-flow data, etc.) from different parts of the underlying network needs to be continuously collected and analyzed for interesting trends. Other applications that generate rapid, continuous and large volumes of stream data include transactions in retail chains, ATM and credit card operations in banks, financial tickers, Web server log records, etc. In most such applications, the data stream is actually accumulated and archived in the DBMS of a (perhaps, off-site) data warehouse, often making access to the archived data prohibitively expensive. Further, the ability to make decisions and infer interesting patterns on-line (i.e., as the data stream arrives) is crucial for several mission-critical tasks that can have significant dollar value for a large corporation (e.g., telecom fraud detection). As a result, recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in designing data-processing algorithms that work over continuous data streams, i.e., algorithms that provide results to user queries while looking at the relevant data items only once and in a fixed order (determined by the stream-arrival pattern). Two key parameters for query processing over continuous datastreams are (1) the amount of memory made available to the online algorithm, and (2) the per-item processing time required by the query processor. The former constitutes an important constraint on the design of stream processing algorithms, since in a typical streaming environment, only limited memory resources are available to the query-processing algorithms. In these situations, we need algorithms that can summarize the data stream(s) involved in a concise, but reasonably accurate, synopsis that can be stored in the allotted (small) amount of memory and can be used to provide approximate answers to user queries along with some reasonable guarantees on the quality of the approximation. Such approx-",

            "abstract": "The popularity of large-scale real-time analytics applications (real-time inventory/pricing, recommendations from mobile apps, fraud detection, risk analysis, IoT, etc.) keeps rising. These applications require distributed data management systems that can handle fast concurrent transactions (OLTP) and analytics on the recent data. Some of them even need running analytical queries (OLAP) as part of transactions. Efficient processing of individual transactional and analytical requests, however, leads to different optimizations and architectural decisions while building a data management system. For the kind of data processing that requires both analytics and transactions, Gartner recently coined the term Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing (HTAP). Many HTAP solutions are emerging both from the industry as well as academia that target these new applications. While some of these are single system solutions, others are a looser coupling of OLTP databases or NoSQL systems with analytical big data platforms, like Spark. The goal of this tutorial is to 1-) quickly review the historical progression of OLTP and OLAP systems, 2-) discuss the driving factors for HTAP, and finally 3-) provide a deep technical analysis of existing and emerging HTAP solutions, detailing their key architectural differences and trade-offs.",

            "abstract": "Extensible markup language (XML) is emerging as a de facto standard for information exchange among various applications on the World Wide Web. There has been a growing need for developing high-performance techniques to query large XML data repositories efficiently. One important problem in XML query processing is twig pattern matching, that is, finding in an XML data tree D all matches that satisfy a specified twig (or path) query pattern Q. In this survey, we review, classify, and compare major techniques for twig pattern matching. Specifically, we consider two classes of major XML query processing techniques: the relational approach and the native approach. The relational approach directly utilizes existing relational database systems to store and query XML data, which enables the use of all important techniques that have been developed for relational databases, whereas in the native approach, specialized storage and query processing systems tailored for XML data are developed from scratch to further improve XML query performance. As implied by existing work, XML data querying and management are developing in the direction of integrating the relational approach with the native approach, which could result in higher query processing performance and also significantly reduce system reengineering costs.",

            "abstract": "Until recently, most data integration techniques involved central components, e.g., global schemas, to enable transparent access to heterogeneous databases. Today, however, with the democratization of tools facilitating knowledge elicitation in machine-processable formats, one cannot rely on global, centralized schemas anymore as knowledge creation and consumption are getting more and more dynamic and decentralized. Peer Data Management Systems (PDMS) provide an answer to this problem by eliminating the central semantic component and considering instead compositions of local, pair-wise mappings to propagate queries from one database to the others. PDMS approaches proposed so far make the implicit assumption that all mappings used in this way are correct. This obviously cannot be taken as granted in typical PDMS settings where mappings can be created (semi) automatically by independent parties. In this work, we propose a totally decentralized, efficient message passing scheme to automatically detect erroneous mappings in PDMS. Our scheme is based on a probabilistic model where we take advantage of transitive closures of mapping operations to confront local belief on the correctness of a mapping against evidences gathered around the network. We show that our scheme can be efficiently embedded in any PDMS and provide a preliminary evaluation of our techniques on sets of both automatically-generated and real-world schemas.",

            "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown superior performance in various areas. And LLMs have the potential to revolutionize data management by serving as the \"brain\" of next-generation database systems. However, there are several challenges that utilize LLMs to optimize databases. First, it is challenging to provide appropriate prompts (e.g., instructions and demonstration examples) to enable LLMs to understand the database optimization problems. Second, LLMs only capture the logical database characters (e.g., SQL semantics) but are not aware of physical characters (e.g., data distributions), and it requires to fine-tune LLMs to capture both physical and logical information. Third, LLMs are not well trained for databases with strict constraints (e.g., query plan equivalence) and privacy-preserving requirements, and it is challenging to train database-specific LLMs while ensuring database privacy. To overcome these challenges, this vision paper proposes a LLM-based database framework (), including automatic prompt generation, DB-specific model fine-tuning, and DB-specific model design and pre-training. Preliminary experiments show that achieves relatively good performance in database tasks like query rewrite and index tuning.

            "abstract": "Bigtable is a distributed storage system for managing structured data that is designed to scale to a very large size: petabytes of data across thousands of commodity servers. Many projects at Google store data in Bigtable, including web indexing, Google Earth, and Google Finance. These applications place very different demands on Bigtable, both in terms of data size (from URLs to web pages to satellite imagery) and latency requirements (from backend bulk processing to real-time data serving). Despite these varied demands, Bigtable has successfully provided a flexible, high-performance solution for all of these Google products. In this article, we describe the simple data model provided by Bigtable, which gives clients dynamic control over data layout and format, and we describe the design and implementation of Bigtable.",

            "abstract": "A major component of many cloud services is query processing on data stored in the underlying cloud cluster. The traditional techniques for query processing on a cluster are those offered by parallel DBMS. These techniques however, cannot guarantee high performance for cloud; parallel DBMS lack adequate fault tolerance mechanisms in order to deal with non-negligible software and hardware failures. MapReduce, on the other hand, allows query processing solutions that are fault tolerant, but imposes substantial overheads. In this paper, we propose an adaptive software architecture which can effortlessly switch between MapReduce and parallel DBMS in order to efficiently process queries regardless of their response times. Switching between the two architectures is performed in a transparent manner based on an intuitive cost model, which computes the expected execution time in presence of failures. The experimental results show that the adaptive architecture achieves the lowest possible query execution time for various scenarios.",

            "abstract": "This paper concerns the fundamental problem of processing conjunctive queries that contain both keyword conditions and range conditions on public clouds in a privacy preserving manner. No prior Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) based privacy-preserving conjunctive query processing scheme satisfies the three requirements of adaptive security, efficient query processing, and scalable index size. In this paper, we propose the first privacy preserving conjunctive query processing scheme that satisfies the above requirements. To achieve adaptive security, we propose an Indistinguishable Bloom Filter (IBF) data structure for indexing. To achieve efficient query processing and structure indistinguishability, we propose a highly balanced binary tree data structure called Indistinguishable Binary Tree (IBtree). To optimize searching efficiency, we propose a traversal width minimization algorithm and a traversal depth minimization algorithm. To achieve scalable and compact index size, we propose an IBtree space compression algorithm to remove redundant information in IBFs. We formally prove that our scheme is adaptive secure using a random oracle model. The key contribution of this paper is on achieving conjunctive query processing with both strong privacy guarantee and practical efficiency in terms of both speed and space. We implemented our scheme in C++, evaluated and compared its performance with KRB [24] for keyword queries and PBtree [32] for range queries on two realworld data sets. Experimental results show that our scheme is fast and scalable (in milliseconds).",

            "abstract": "The huge diversity of database technologies in use inside organizations pose today new challenges of data management and integration. Polystores provide a solution to this scenario based on a loosely coupled integration of data sources and the direct access, with the local language, to each storage engine for exploiting its distinctive features. However, given the absence of a global schema, it is hard to know if a query to one system can be satisfied with data stored elsewhere in the polystore. We address this issue by introducing query augmentation, a data manipulation operator for polystores based on the automatic enrichment of the answer to a local query with related data in the rest of the polystore. Augmentation can be used to implement two effective methods for data access in polystores: augmented search and augmented exploration. We show that they provide effective tools for information discovery in polystores that avoid middleware layers, abstract query languages, and shared data models. We also illustrate the design of QUEPA, a system that fully implements our approach in an efficient way. A comprehensive campaign of experiments done with QUEPA shows that our approach is feasible and, unlike other approaches, scales nicely as the polystore grows in the number of stores and size of databases.",

            "abstract": "As computing power increases exponentially, vast amount of data is created by many scientific research activities. However, the bandwidth for storing the data to disks and reading the data from disks has been improving at a much slower pace. These two trends produce an ever-widening data access gap. Our work brings together two distinct technologies to address this data access issue: indexing and in situ processing. From decades of database research literature, we know that indexing is an effective way to address the data access issue, particularly for accessing relatively small fraction of data records. As data sets increase in sizes, more and more analysts need to use selective data access, which makes indexing an even more important for improving data access. The challenge is that most implementations of indexing technology are embedded in large database management systems (DBMS), but most scientific datasets are not managed by any DBMS. In this work, we choose to include indexes with the scientific data instead of requiring the data to be loaded into a DBMS.We use compressed bitmap indexes from the FastBit software which are known to be highly effective for query-intensive workloads common to scientific data analysis. To use the indexes, we need to build them first. The index building procedure needs to access the whole data set and may also require a significant amount of compute time. In this work, we adapt the in situ processing technology to generate the indexes, thus removing the need of reading data from disks and to build indexes in parallel. The in situ data processing system used is ADIOS, a middleware for high-performance I/O. Our experimental results show that the indexes can improve the data access time up to 200 times depending on the fraction of data selected, and using in situ data processing system can effectively reduce the time needed to create the indexes, up to 10 times with our in situ technique when using identical parallel settings.",

            "abstract": "The last decade has witnessed the prevalence of sensor and GPS technologies that produce a high volume of trajectory data representing the motion history of moving objects. However some characteristics of trajectories such as variable lengths and asynchronous sampling rates make it difficult to fit into traditional database systems that are disk-based and tuple-oriented. Motivated by the success of column store and recent development of in-memory databases, we try to explore the potential opportunities of boosting the performance of trajectory data processing by designing a novel trajectory storage within main memory. In contrast to most existing trajectory indexing methods that keep consecutive samples of the same trajectory in the same disk page, we partition the database into frames in which the positions of all moving objects at the same time instant are stored together and aligned in main memory. We found this column-wise storage to be surprisingly well suited for in-memory computing since most frames can be stored in highly compressed form, which is pivotal for increasing the memory throughput and reducing CPU-cache miss. The independence between frames also makes them natural working units when parallelizing data processing on a multi-core environment. Lastly we run a variety of common trajectory queries on both real and synthetic datasets in order to demonstrate advantages and study the limitations of our proposed storage.",

            "abstract": "\u2014The advancements in technology such as Web 2.0, 3.0, mobile devices and recently IoT devices has given rise to a massive amount of structured, semi-structure and unstructured datasets, i.e. big data. The increasing complexity and diversity of data sources poses significant challenges for stakeholders when extracting meaningful insights. This paper demonstrates how we developed a unified query prototype as middleware using a polyglot technique capable of interrogating and manipulating the four categories of NoSQL data models. This study applied established algorithms to different aspects of the prototype to attain this study\u2019s objective. The prototype was subjected to an experiment where varying query workloads were processed. The performance data comprised of application performance index, memory consumption, and execution time and error rates. The results demonstrated that the prototype had a low error rate indicating it\u2019s robustness and reliability. In addition, the results showed that the prototype is responsive and able to query the underlying storage system effectively and efficiently. The prototype provides a standardize set of operations abstracting the complexities of each underlying storage system; reducing the need for multiple data retrieval management systems.",

With a shared-nothing architecture, it exposes a fast key-value store with a managed cache for sub-millisecond data operations, indexing for fast queries, and a powerful query engine for executing declarative SQL-like queries. Its Query Service debuted several years ago and supports high volumes of low-latency queries and updates for JSON documents. Its recently introduced Analytics Service complements the Query Service. Couchbase Analytics, the focus of this paper, supports complex analytical queries (e.g., ad hoc joins and aggregations) over large collections of JSON documents. This paper describes the Analytics Service from the outside in, including its user model, its SQL++ based query language, and its MPP-based storage and query processing architecture. It also briefly touches on the relationship of Couchbase Analytics to Apache AsterixDB, the open source Big Data management system at the core of Couchbase Analytics.",

            "abstract": "The extreme volume and staggeringly increasing rate inevitably produce unprecedented pressure on any large scale video sharing and hosting systems. Among the efforts to mitigate this pressure, content-based video similarity search is becoming more and more important with the exponential growth of the data size. Though various approaches have been proposed to address this problem, they are mainly focusing on the retrieval accuracy thus bringing video features with high complexity. Due to the complexity of the feature, these systems are based on the assumption that features representing videos have been obtained offline and stored in the database statically. However, the on-call efforts to move the feature extraction and similarity search from offline to online have been ignored in previous work. In this paper, we propose Marlin, a streaming data processing pipeline that efficiently extracts video features and retrieves video similarity information in a large scale video data system. We design a streaming feature extractor to handle the videos streaming into the system and establish the fined-grained resource allocation with a resource-aware data abstraction layer over streaming data to allocate computing resources among the videos with various resource demands. Besides that, we are pipelining the feature extraction and similarity search process with a distributed feature index, which supports real-time query and incremental index update. The experimental and the extensive real-world workload driven simulation results show that the proposed stream processing architecture achieves 25X speedup against the sequential feature extraction algorithm and 23X speedup against the sequential similarity search with a subsecond similarity query latency for a single request.",

            "abstract": "Many applications in real life can produce a large amount of data which can be modeled by a graph. A large graph usually has millions of vertices and billions of edges. This paper presents a BSP-based system, called BC-BSP+, to process large graphs iteratively in parallel. It has the flexibility to configure policies (i.e., disk management parameters) and extend functions (i.e., programming interfaces), to compute large-scale graphs, to tolerate faults, and to balance loads. Especially, three graph partition strategies in BC-BSP+ are proposed to support large graph processing: Randomized Hash Partition (RHP), Balanced Hash Partition (BHP) and Vertex-Cut based on the Range Partition method (VCRP). Lots of experiments are conducted to evaluate BC-BSP+. The experimental results show that the performance of VCRP is better than that of BHP, but the latter is more general. We compare BC-BSP+ with Hadoop, a system based on MapReduce, and the speedup is roughly 8. Moreover, compared with the BSP-based systems, Hama and Giraph, the speedup is also 2 to 6 benefitting from VCRP.",

Massive and heterogeneous data of the Internet of Things brings the storage huge challenges. Based on the analysis of the IoT data characteristics, this paper proposed a storage management solution called IOTMDB based on NoSQL as current storage solutions are not well support storing massive and heterogeneous IoT data. Besides, the storage strategies about expressing and organizing IoT data in a uniform manner were proposed, some evaluations were carried out. Furthermore, we not only just concerned about descripting the data itself, but also cared for sharing of the data, so a data sharing mechanism based on ontology was proposed. Finally, index was studied and a set of query syntaxes to meet the needs of different kinds of IoT queries based NoSQL was given.",

            "abstract": "In emerging Big Data scenarios, obtaining timely, high-quality answers to aggregate queries is difficult due to the challenges of processing and cleaning large, dirty data sets. To increase the speed of query processing, there has been a resurgence of interest in sampling-based approximate query processing (SAQP). In its usual formulation, however, SAQP does not address data cleaning at all, and in fact, exacerbates answer quality problems by introducing sampling error. In this paper, we explore an intriguing opportunity. That is, we explore the use of sampling to actually improve answer quality. We introduce the Sample-and-Clean framework, which applies data cleaning to a relatively small subset of the data and uses the results of the cleaning process to lessen the impact of dirty data on aggregate query answers. We derive confidence intervals as a function of sample size and show how our approach addresses error bias. We evaluate the Sample-and-Clean framework using data from three sources: the TPC-H benchmark with synthetic noise, a subset of the Microsoft academic citation index and a sensor data set. Our results are consistent with the theoretical confidence intervals and suggest that the Sample-and-Clean framework can produce significant improvements in accuracy compared to query processing without data cleaning and speed compared to data cleaning without sampling.",

            "abstract": "With the development of positioning technologies and the boosting deployment of inexpensive location-aware sensors, large volumes of trajectory data have emerged. However, efficient and scalable query processing over trajectory data remains a big challenge. We explore a new approach to this target in this paper, presenting a new framework for query processing over trajectory data based on MapReduce. Traditional trajectory data partitioning, indexing, and query processing technologies are extended so that they may fully utilize the highly parallel processing power of large-scale clusters. We also show that the append-only scheme of MapReduce storage model can be a nice base for handling updates of moving objects. Preliminary experiments show that this framework scales well in terms of the size of trajectory data set. It is also discussed the limitation of traditional trajectory data processing techniques and our future research directions.",

            "abstract": "Lightweight computing devices are becoming ubiquitous and an increasing number of applications are being developed for these devices. Many of these applications deal with significant amounts of data and involve complex joins and aggregate operations, which necessitate a local database management system on the device. This is a challenge as these devices are constrained by limited stable storage and main memory. Hence new storage models that reduce storage costs are needed and a storage scheme should be selected based on data characteristics, nature of queries, and updates. Also, query execution plan should be chosen depending on the amount of available memory and the underlying storage scheme; memory should be optimally allocated among the database operators involved in the query. To achieve these goals, we utilize a novel storage model, ID based storage, which reduces storage costs considerably. We present an exact algorithm for allocating memory among the database operators. Because of its high complexity, we also propose a heuristic solution based on the benefit of an operator per unit memory allocation.",

            "abstract": "Real-time city crowd flows are extremely important for facility placement, transportation management, and public safety. In this paper, we show how to derive the real-time city crowd flows with heterogeneous urban data. Unlike existing prediction-based approaches, our proposal does not rely on the training data and learning models. We propose a computation framework for it by exploiting the massive heterogeneous urban data, which includes both immutable data (i.e., bus and subway stations, commercial-based regions) and mutable data (i.e., real-time taxi, bus, subway transactions and trajectories). In addition, our solution provides accurate and timely city crowd-flows.To provide a practical solution for it, we first partition the city into commercial-based regions with geographic information (e.g., road network, administrative regions). Then, we devise three major components (i.e., urban data fusion model, heterogeneous urban data integration model, and effective crowd flows computation model) in the computation framework to process massive heterogeneous urban data effectively and derive city crowd flows accurately. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed solution with real heterogeneous urban data in Shenzhen, China.",

            "abstract": "Due to the ubiquity of spatial data applications and the large amounts of spatial data that these applications generate and process, there is a pressing need for scalable spatial query processing. In this paper, we present new techniques for spatial query processing and optimization in an in-memory and distributed setup to address scalability. More specifically, we introduce new techniques for handling query skew that commonly happens in practice, and minimizes communication costs accordingly. We propose a distributed query scheduler that uses a new cost model to minimize the cost of spatial query processing. The scheduler generates query execution plans that minimize the effect of query skew. The query scheduler utilizes new spatial indexing techniques based on bitmap filters to forward queries to the appropriate local nodes. Each local computation node is responsible for optimizing and selecting its best local query execution plan based on the indexes and the nature of the spatial queries in that node. All the proposed spatial query processing and optimization techniques are prototyped inside Spark, a distributed memory-based computation system. Our prototype system is termed LocationSpark. The experimental study is based on real datasets and demonstrates that LocationSpark can enhance distributed spatial query processing by up to an order of magnitude over existing in-memory and distributed spatial systems.",

            "abstract": "The NIH-funded LINCS Consortium is creating an extensive reference library of cell-based perturbation response signatures and sophisticated informatics tools incorporating a large number of perturbagens, model systems, and assays. To date, more than 350 datasets have been generated including transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenomics, cell phenotype and competitive binding profiling assays. The large volume and variety of data necessitate rigorous data standards and effective data management including modular data processing pipelines and end-user interfaces to facilitate accurate and reliable data exchange, curation, validation, standardization, aggregation, integration, and end user access. Deep metadata annotations and the use of qualified data standards enable integration with many external resources. Here we describe the end-to-end data processing and management at the DCIC to generate a high-quality and persistent product. Our data management and stewardship solutions enable a functioning Consortium and make LINCS a valuable scientific resource that aligns with big data initiatives such as the BD2K NIH Program and concords with emerging data science best practices including the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) principles.",

            "abstract": "There is an increasing adoption of machine learning for encoding data into vectors to serve online recommendation and search use cases. As a result, recent data management systems propose augmenting query processing with online vector similarity search. In this work, we explore vector similarity search in the context of Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Motivated by the tasks of finding related KG queries and entities for past KG query workloads, we focus on hybrid vector similarity search (hybrid queries for short) where part of the query corresponds to vector similarity search and part of the query corresponds to predicates over relational attributes associated with the underlying data vectors. For example, given past KG queries for a song entity, we want to construct new queries for new song entities whose vector representations are close to the vector representation of the entity in the past KG query. But entities in a KG also have non-vector attributes such as a song associated with an artist, a genre, and a release date. Therefore, suggested entities must also satisfy query predicates over non-vector attributes beyond a vector-based similarity predicate. While these tasks are central to KGs, our contributions are generally applicable to hybrid queries. In contrast to prior works that optimize online queries, we focus on enabling efficient batch processing of past hybrid query workloads. We present our system, HQI, for high-throughput batch processing of hybrid queries. We introduce a workload-aware vector data partitioning scheme to tailor the vector index layout to the given workload and describe a multi-query optimization technique to reduce the overhead of vector similarity computations. We evaluate our methods on industrial workloads and demonstrate that HQI yields a 31\u00d7 improvement in throughput for finding related KG queries compared to existing hybrid query processing approaches.",

DBMS technology plays a crucial role in the storage, organisation, retrieval, and manipulation of vast amounts of data in various domains, ranging from business operations to scientific research. This abstract highlights the key aspects covered in the paper, including the evolution of DBMS, its architectural components, and the challenges and advancements in the field.\n\nThe paper begins by discussing the historical development of DBMS, tracing its origins from file-based systems to the emergence of relational databases and the subsequent rise of object-oriented and NoSQL databases. We explore the motivations behind these advancements and their impact on data management.\n\nNext, we delve into the fundamental architectural components of a DBMS. We examine the storage layer, which encompasses data structures and access methods, and discuss different indexing techniques for efficient data retrieval. The query processing and optimization module are explored, focusing on query execution plans and cost-based optimization strategies. Additionally, we analyse the transaction management component, highlighting concepts such as ACID properties, concurrency control, and recovery mechanisms.\n\nThe abstract also highlights the challenges faced by modern DBMS. With the proliferation of big data and the advent of cloud computing, scalability, availability, and performance have become critical concerns. We examine techniques such as parallel and distributed databases, replication, and sharding to address these challenges. Furthermore, we discuss the integration of DBMS with emerging technologies like machine learning and blockchain to leverage their capabilities in data analytics and secure data transactions.\n\nLastly, the abstract touches upon recent advancements in DBMS, including the rise of graph databases for managing interconnected data, the adoption of in-memory databases for high-performance applications, and the exploration of new database models to handle unstructured and semi-structured data.\n\nIn conclusion, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of DBMS, covering its historical evolution, architectural components, challenges, and recent advancements. By understanding the principles and advancements in DBMS, researchers and practitioners can effectively harness the power of data management systems to tackle the complexities of modern data-driven applications.",

            "abstract": "Data warehousing and on-line analytical processing (OLAP) are essential elements of decision support, which has increasingly become a focus of the database industry. Many commercial products and services are now available, and all of the principal database management system vendors now have offerings in these areas. Decision support places some rather different requirements on database technology compared to traditional on-line transaction processing applications. This paper provides an overview of data warehousing and OLAP technologies, with an emphasis on their new requirements. We describe back end tools for extracting, cleaning and loading data into a data warehouse; multidimensional data models typical of OLAP; front end client tools for querying and data analysis; server extensions for efficient query processing; and tools for metadata management and for managing the warehouse. In addition to surveying the state of the art, this paper also identifies some promising research issues, some of which are related to problems that the database research community has worked on for years, but others are only just beginning to be addressed. This overview is based on a tutorial that the authors presented at the VLDB Conference, 1996.",

            "abstract": "Hadapt is a start-up company currently commercializing the Yale University research project called HadoopDB. The company focuses on building a platform for Big Data analytics in the cloud by introducing a storage layer optimized for structured data and by providing a framework for executing SQL queries efficiently. This work considers processing data warehousing queries over very large datasets. Our goal is to maximize perfor mance while, at the same time, not giving up fault tolerance and scalability. We analyze the complexity of this problem in the split execution environment of HadoopDB. Here, incoming queries are examined; parts of the query are pushed down and executed inside the higher performing database layer; and the rest of the query is processed in a more generic MapReduce framework.\n In this paper, we discuss in detail performance-oriented query execution strategies for data warehouse queries in split execution environments, with particular focus on join and aggregation operations. The efficiency of our techniques is demonstrated by running experiments using the TPC-H benchmark with 3TB of data. In these experiments we compare our results with a standard commercial parallel database and an open-source MapReduce implementation featuring a SQL interface (Hive). We show that HadoopDB successfully competes with other systems.",

            "abstract": "Distributed computing remains inaccessible to a large number of users, in spite of many open source platforms and extensive commercial offerings. While distributed computation frameworks have moved beyond a simple map-reduce model, many users are still left to struggle with complex cluster management and configuration tools, even for running simple embarrassingly parallel jobs. We argue that stateless functions represent a viable platform for these users, eliminating cluster management overhead, fulfilling the promise of elasticity. Furthermore, using our prototype implementation, PyWren, we show that this model is general enough to implement a number of distributed computing models, such as BSP, efficiently. Extrapolating from recent trends in network bandwidth and the advent of disaggregated storage, we suggest that stateless functions are a natural fit for data processing in future computing environments.",

            "abstract": "Molecular Simulation (MS) is a powerful tool for studying physical/chemical features of large systems and has seen applications in many scientific and engineering domains. During the simulation process, the experiments generate a very large number of atoms and intend to observe their spatial and temporal relationships for scientific analysis. The sheer data volumes and their intensive interactions impose significant challenges for data accessing, managing, and analysis. To date, existing MS software systems fall short on storage and handling of MS data, mainly because of the missing of a platform to support applications that involve intensive data access and analytical process. In this paper, we present the database-centric molecular simulation (DCMS) system our team developed in the past few years. The main idea behind DCMS is to store MS data in a relational database management system (DBMS) to take advantage of the declarative query interface (i.e., SQL), data access methods, query processing, and optimization mechanisms of modern DBMSs. A unique challenge is to handle the analytical queries that are often compute-intensive. For that, we developed novel indexing and query processing strategies (including algorithms running on modern co-processors) as integrated components of the DBMS. As a result, researchers can upload and analyze their data using efficient functions implemented inside the DBMS. Index structures are generated to store analysis results that may be interesting to other users, so that the results are readily available without duplicating the analysis. We have developed a prototype of DCMS based on the PostgreSQL system and experiments using real MS data and workload show that DCMS significantly outperforms existing MS software systems. We also used it as a platform to test other data management issues such as security and compression.",

            "abstract": "In big data era, the ever-increasing image data has posed significant challenge on modern image retrieval. It is of great importance to index images with semantic keywords efficiently and effectively, especially confronted with fast-evolving property of the web. Learning-based hashing has shown its power in handling large-scale high-dimensional applications, such as image retrieval. Existing solutions normally separate the process of learning binary codes and hash functions into two independent stages to bypass challenge of the discrete constraints on binary codes. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised hashing approach, namely robust discrete hashing (RDSH), to facilitate large-scale semantic indexing of image data. Specifically, RDSH simultaneously learns discrete binary codes as well as robust hash functions within a unified model. In order to suppress the influence of unreliable binary codes and learn robust hash functions, we also integrate a flexible `2;p loss with nonlinear kernel embedding to adapt to different noise levels. Finally, we devise an alternating algorithm to efficiently optimize RDSH model. Given a test image, we first conduct r-nearest-neighbor search based on Hamming distance of binary codes, and then propagate semantic keywords of neighbors to the test image. Extensive experiments have been conducted on various real-world image datasets to show its superiority to the state-of-the-arts in large-scale semantic indexing.",

            "abstract": "\n AsterixDB is a new, full-function BDMS (Big Data Management System) with a feature set that distinguishes it from other platforms in today's open source Big Data ecosystem. Its features make it well-suited to applications like web data warehousing, social data storage and analysis, and other use cases related to Big Data. AsterixDB has a flexible NoSQL style data model; a query language that supports a wide range of queries; a scalable runtime; partitioned, LSM-based data storage and indexing (including B\n +\n -tree, R-tree, and text indexes); support for external as well as natively stored data; a rich set of built-in types; support for fuzzy, spatial, and temporal types and queries; a built-in notion of data feeds for ingestion of data; and transaction support akin to that of a NoSQL store.\n \n Development of AsterixDB began in 2009 and led to a mid-2013 initial open source release. This paper is the first complete description of the resulting open source AsterixDB system. Covered herein are the system's data model, its query language, and its software architecture. Also included are a summary of the current status of the project and a first glimpse into how AsterixDB performs when compared to alternative technologies, including a parallel relational DBMS, a popular NoSQL store, and a popular Hadoop-based SQL data analytics platform, for things that both technologies can do. Also included is a brief description of some initial trials that the system has undergone and the lessons learned (and plans laid) based on those early \"customer\" engagements.",

            "abstract": "As the challenge of our time, Big Data still has many research hassles, especially the variety of data. The high diversity of data sources often results in information silos, a collection of non-integrated data management systems with heterogeneous schemas, query languages, and APIs. Data Lake systems have been proposed as a solution to this problem, by providing a schema-less repository for raw data with a common access interface. However, just dumping all data into a data lake without any metadata management, would only lead to a 'data swamp'. To avoid this, we propose Constance, a Data Lake system with sophisticated metadata management over raw data extracted from heterogeneous data sources. Constance discovers, extracts, and summarizes the structural metadata from the data sources, and annotates data and metadata with semantic information to avoid ambiguities. With embedded query rewriting engines supporting structured data and semi-structured data, Constance provides users a unified interface for query processing and data exploration. During the demo, we will walk through each functional component of Constance. Constance will be applied to two real-life use cases in order to show attendees the importance and usefulness of our generic and extensible data lake system.",

            "abstract": "The collection of time series data increases as more monitoring and automation are being deployed. These deployments range in scale from an Internet of things (IoT) device located in a household to enormous distributed Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) producing large volumes of data at high velocity. To store and analyze these vast amounts of data, specialized Time Series Management Systems (TSMSs) have been developed to overcome the limitations of general purpose Database Management Systems (DBMSs) for times series management. In this paper, we present a thorough analysis and classification of TSMSs developed through academic or industrial research and documented through publications. Our classification is organized into categories based on the architectures observed during our analysis. In addition, we provide an overview of each system with a focus on the motivational use case that drove the development of the system, the functionality for storage and querying of time series a system implements, the components the system is composed of, and the capabilities of each system with regard to Stream Processing  and Approximate Query Processing (AQP). Last, we provide a summary of research directions proposed by other researchers in the field and present our vision for a next generation TSMS.",

            "abstract": "Following the adoption of basic temporal features in the SQL:2011 standard, there has been a tremendous interest within the database industry in supporting bi-temporal features, as a significant number of real-life workloads would greatly benefit from efficient temporal operations. However, current implementations of bi-temporal storage systems and operators are far from optimal. In this paper, we present the Bi-temporal Timeline Index, which supports a broad range of temporal operators and exploits the special properties of an in-memory column store database system. Comprehensive performance experiments with the TPC-BiH benchmark show that algorithms based on the Bi-temporal Timeline Index outperform significantly both existing commercial database systems and state-of-the-art data structures from research.",

            "abstract": "Learned indexes have been proposed to replace classic index structures like B-Tree with machine learning (ML) models. They require to replace both the indexes and query processing algorithms currently deployed by the databases, and such a radical departure is likely to encounter challenges and obstacles. In contrast, we propose a fundamentally different way of using ML techniques to build a better R-Tree without the need to change the structure or query processing algorithms of traditional R-Tree. Specifically, we develop reinforcement learning (RL) based models to decide how to choose a subtree for insertion and how to split a node when building and updating an R-Tree, instead of relying on hand-crafted heuristic rules currently used by the R-Tree and its variants. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets with up to more than 100 million spatial objects show that our RL based index outperforms the R-Tree and its variants in terms of query processing time.",

            "abstract": "This paper describes SpatialHadoop; a full-fledged MapReduce framework with native support for spatial data. SpatialHadoop is a comprehensive extension to Hadoop that injects spatial data awareness in each Hadoop layer, namely, the language, storage, MapReduce, and operations layers. In the language layer, SpatialHadoop adds a simple and expressive high level language for spatial data types and operations. In the storage layer, SpatialHadoop adapts traditional spatial index structures, Grid, R-tree and R+-tree, to form a two-level spatial index. SpatialHadoop enriches the MapReduce layer by two new components, SpatialFileSplitter and SpatialRecordReader, for efficient and scalable spatial data processing. In the operations layer, SpatialHadoop is already equipped with a dozen of operations, including range query, kNN, and spatial join. Other spatial operations are also implemented following a similar approach. Extensive experiments on real system prototype and real datasets show that SpatialHadoop achieves orders of magnitude better performance than Hadoop for spatial data processing.",

            "abstract": "Spatial objects often come with textual information, such as Points of Interest (POIs) with their descriptions, which are referred to as geo-textual data. To retrieve such data, spatial keyword queries that take into account both spatial proximity and textual relevance have been extensively studied. Existing indexes designed for spatial keyword queries are mostly built based on the geo-textual data without considering the distribution of queries already received. However, previous studies have shown that utilizing the known query distribution can improve the index structure for future query processing. In this paper, we propose WISK, a learned index for spatial keyword queries, which self-adapts for optimizing querying costs given a query workload. One key challenge is how to utilize both structured spatial attributes and unstructured textual information during learning the index. We first divide the data objects into partitions, aiming to minimize the processing costs of the given query workload. We prove the NP-hardness of the partitioning problem and propose a machine learning model to find the optimal partitions. Then, to achieve more pruning power, we build a hierarchical structure based on the generated partitions in a bottom-up manner with a reinforcement learning-based approach. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets and query workloads with various distributions, and the results show that WISK outperforms all competitors, achieving up to 8\u00d7 speedup in querying time with comparable storage overhead.",

            "abstract": "Data quality is one of the most important problems in data management. A database system typically aims to support the creation, maintenance, and use of large amount of data, focusing on the quantity of data. However, real-life data are often dirty: inconsistent, duplicated, inaccurate, incomplete, or stale. Dirty data in a database routinely generate misleading or biased analytical results and decisions, and lead to loss of revenues, credibility and customers. With this comes the need for data quality management. In contrast to traditional data management tasks, data quality management enables the detection and correction of errors in the data, syntactic or semantic, in order to improve the quality of the data and hence, add value to business processes. While data quality has been a longstanding problem for decades, the prevalent use of the Web has increased the risks, on an unprecedented scale, of creating and propagating dirty data. This monograph gives an overview of fundamental issues underlying central aspects of data quality, namely, data consistency, data deduplication, data accuracy, data currency, and information completeness. We promote a uniform logical framework for dealing with these issues, based on data quality rules. \n \nThe text is organized into seven chapters, focusing on relational data. Chapter One introduces data quality issues. A conditional dependency theory is developed in Chapter Two, for capturing data inconsistencies. It is followed by practical techniques in Chapter 2b for discovering conditional dependencies, and for detecting inconsistencies and repairing data based on conditional dependencies. Matching dependencies are introduced in Chapter Three, as matching rules for data deduplication. A theory of relative information completeness is studied in Chapter Four, revising the classical Closed World Assumption and the Open World Assumption, to characterize incomplete information in the real world. A data currency model is presented in Chapter Five, to identify the current values of entities in a database and to answer queries with the current values, in the absence of reliable timestamps. Finally, interactions between these data quality issues are explored in Chapter Six. Important theoretical results and practical algorithms are covered, but formal proofs are omitted. The bibliographical notes contain pointers to papers in which the results were presented and proven, as well as references to materials for further reading. \n \nThis text is intended for a seminar course at the graduate level. It is also to serve as a useful resource for researchers and practitioners who are interested in the study of data quality. The fundamental research on data quality draws on several areas, including mathematical logic, computational complexity and database theory. It has raised as many questions as it has answered, and is a rich source of questions and vitality. \n \nTable of Contents: Data Quality: An Overview / Conditional Dependencies / Cleaning Data with Conditional Dependencies / Data Deduplication / Information Completeness / Data Currency / Interactions between Data Quality Issues",

            "abstract": "The pervasiveness of GPS-enabled devices and wireless communication technologies results in massive trajectory data, incurring expensive cost for storage, transmission, and query processing. To relieve this problem, in this paper we propose a novel framework for compressing trajectory data, REST (Reference-based Spatio-temporal trajectory compression), by which a raw trajectory is represented by concatenation of a series of historical (sub-)trajectories (called reference trajectories) that form the compressed trajectory within a given spatio-temporal deviation threshold. In order to construct a reference trajectory set that can most benefit the subsequent compression, we propose three kinds of techniques to select reference trajectories wisely from a large dataset such that the resulting reference set is more compact yet covering most footprints of trajectories in the area of interest. To address the computational issue caused by the large number of combinations of reference trajectories that may exist for resembling a given trajectory, we propose efficient greedy algorithms that run in the blink of an eye and dynamic programming algorithms that can achieve the optimal compression ratio. Compared to existing work on trajectory compression, our framework has few assumptions about data such as moving within a road network or moving with constant direction and speed, and better compression performance with fairly small spatio-temporal loss. In addition, by indexing the reference trajectories directly with an in-memory R-tree and building connections to the raw trajectories with inverted index, we develop an extremely efficient algorithm that can answer spatio-temporal range queries over trajectories in their compressed form. Extensive experiments on a real taxi trajectory dataset demonstrate the superiority of our framework over existing representative approaches in terms of both compression ratio and efficiency.",

            "abstract": "The SAP HANA database is the core of SAP's new data management platform. The overall goal of the SAP HANA database is to provide a generic but powerful system for different query scenarios, both transactional and analytical, on the same data representation within a highly scalable execution environment. Within this paper, we highlight the main features that differentiate the SAP HANA database from classical relational database engines. Therefore, we outline the general architecture and design criteria of the SAP HANA in a first step. In a second step, we challenge the common belief that column store data structures are only superior in analytical workloads and not well suited for transactional workloads. We outline the concept of record life cycle management to use different storage formats for the different stages of a record. We not only discuss the general concept but also dive into some of the details of how to efficiently propagate records through their life cycle and moving database entries from write-optimized to read-optimized storage formats. In summary, the paper aims at illustrating how the SAP HANA database is able to efficiently work in analytical as well as transactional workload environments.",

            "abstract": "\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive picture of the innovative efforts undertaken over time to develop the digital technologies for managing the interface between supply chain management and marketing processes and the role they play in sustaining supply chain management-marketing (SCM-M) integration from an information processing point of view.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nPatent analysis and actual examples are used to carry out this study. In detail, first, the authors identify the subset of enabling technologies pertaining to the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) that can be considered the most relevant for effective SCM-M integration (i.e. Industrial Internet of Things, Cloud computing, Big Data analytics and customer profiling, Cyber security). Second, the authors carry out a patent analysis aimed at providing a comprehensive overview of the patenting activity trends characterizing the set of digital technologies under investigation, hence highlighting their innovation dynamics and applications.\n\n\nFindings\nThis research provides insightful information about which digital technologies may enable the SCM-M integration. Specifically, the authors highlight the role those solutions play in terms of information acquisition, storage and elaboration for SCM-M integration by relying on illustrative actual examples. Moreover, the authors present the organisations more involved in the development of digital technologies for SCM-M integration over time and offer an examination of their technological impact in terms of influence on subsequent technological developments.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nSo far, much has been said about why marketing and supply chain management functions should be integrated. However, a clear picture of the digital technologies that might be adopted to achieve this objective has yet to be revealed. Thus, the paper contributes to the literature on SCM-M integration and Industry 4.0 by highlighting the enabling technologies for the Industry 4.0 that may particularly serve for managing the SCM-M interface from an information processing perspective.\n",

            "title": "An Application of Storage-Optimal MatDot Codes for Coded Matrix Multiplication: Fast k-Nearest Neighbors Estimation",
            "abstract": "We propose a novel application of coded computing to the problem of the nearest neighbor estimation using MatDot Codes (Fahim et al., Allerton\u201917) that are known to be optimal for matrix multiplication in terms of recovery threshold under storage constraints. In approximate nearest neighbor algorithms, it is common to construct efficient in-memory indexes to improve query response time. One such strategy is Multiple Random Projection Trees (MRPT), which reduces the set of candidate points over which Euclidean distance calculations are performed. However, this may result in a high memory footprint and possibly paging penalties for large or high-dimensional data. Here we propose two techniques to parallelize MRPT that exploit data and model parallelism respectively by dividing both the data storage and the computation efforts among different nodes in a distributed computing cluster. This is especially critical when a single compute node cannot hold the complete dataset in memory. We also propose a novel coded computation strategy based on MatDot codes for the model-parallel architecture that, in a straggler-prone environment, achieves the storage-optimal recovery threshold, i.e., the number of nodes that are required to serve a query. We experimentally demonstrate that, in the absence of straggling, our distributed approaches require less query time than execution on a single processing node, providing near-linear speedups with respect to the number of worker nodes. Our experiments on real systems with simulated straggling, we also show that in a straggler-prone environment, our strategy achieves a faster query execution than the uncoded strategy.",

            "abstract": "CRISP-DM(CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) has its origins in the second half of the nineties and is thus about two decades old. According to many surveys and user polls it is still the de facto standard for developing data mining and knowledge discovery projects. However, undoubtedly the field has moved on considerably in twenty years, with data science now the leading term being favoured over data mining. In this paper we investigate whether, and in what contexts, CRISP-DM is still fit for purpose for data science projects. We argue that if the project is goal-directed and process-driven the process model view still largely holds. On the other hand, when data science projects become more exploratory the paths that the project can take become more varied, and a more flexible model is called for. We suggest what the outlines of such a trajectory-based model might look like and how it can be used to categorise data science projects (goal-directed, exploratory or data management). We examine seven real-life exemplars where exploratory activities play an important role and compare them against 51 use cases extracted from the NIST Big Data Public Working Group. We anticipate this categorisation can help project planning in terms of time and cost characteristics.",

For this purpose, Content-Based Video Retrieval (CBVR) is nowadays an active area of research. In this article, a CBVR system providing similar videos from a large multimedia dataset based on query video has been proposed. This approach uses vector motion-based signatures to describe the visual content and uses machine learning techniques to extract key frames for rapid browsing and efficient video indexing. The proposed method has been implemented on both single machine and real-time distributed cluster to evaluate the real-time performance aspect, especially when the number and size of videos are large. Experiments were performed using various benchmark action and activity recognition datasets and the results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed method in both accuracy and processing time compared to previous studies.",

            "abstract": "\n Hardware enclaves such as Intel SGX are a promising technology for improving the security of databases outsourced to the cloud. These enclaves provide an execution environment isolated from the hyper-visor/OS, and encrypt data in RAM. However, for applications that use large amounts of memory, including most databases, enclaves do not protect against\n access pattern\n leaks, which let attackers gain a large amount of information about the data. Moreover, the na\u00efve way to address this issue, using Oblivious RAM (ORAM) primitives from the security literature, adds substantial overhead.\n \n A number of recent works explore trusted hardware enclaves as a path toward secure, access-pattern oblivious outsourcing of data storage and analysis. While these works efficiently solve specific subproblems (e.g. building secure indexes or running analytics queries that always scan entire tables), no prior work has supported oblivious query processing for general query workloads on a DBMS engine with multiple access methods. Moreover, applying these techniques individually does not guarantee that an end-to-end workload, such as a complex SQL query over multiple tables, will be oblivious. In this paper, we introduce ObliDB, an oblivious database engine design that is the first system to provide obliviousness for general database read workloads over multiple access methods.\n \n ObliDB introduces a diverse array of new oblivious physical operators to accelerate oblivious SQL queries, giving speedups of up to an order of magnitude over na\u00efve ORAM. It supports a broad range of queries, including aggregation, joins, insertions, deletions and point queries. We implement ObliDB and show that, on analytics workloads, ObliDB ranges from 1.1--19x faster than Opaque, a previous oblivious, enclave-based system designed\n only\n for analytics, and comes within 2.6 x of Spark SQL, which provides no security guarantees. In addition, ObliDB supports point queries with 3--10ms latency, which is comparable to index-only trusted hardware systems, and runs over 7x faster than HIRB, a previous encryption-based oblivious index system that supports point queries.\n",

            "abstract": "Due to the increasing popularity of cloud computing, more and more data owners are motivated to outsource their data to cloud servers for great convenience and reduced cost in data management. However, sensitive data should be encrypted before outsourcing for privacy requirements, which obsoletes data utilization like keyword-based document retrieval. In this paper, we present a secure multi-keyword ranked search scheme over encrypted cloud data, which simultaneously supports dynamic update operations like deletion and insertion of documents. Specifically, the vector space model and the widely-used TF x IDF model are combined in the index construction and query generation. We construct a special tree-based index structure and propose a \u201cGreedy Depth-first Search\u201d algorithm to provide efficient multi-keyword ranked search. The secure kNN algorithm is utilized to encrypt the index and query vectors, and meanwhile ensure accurate relevance score calculation between encrypted index and query vectors. In order to resist statistical attacks, phantom terms are added to the index vector for blinding search results. Due to the use of our special tree-based index structure, the proposed scheme can achieve sub-linear search time and deal with the deletion and insertion of documents flexibly. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme.",

            "abstract": "The broadening adoption of machine learning in the enterprise is increasing the pressure for strict governance and cost-effective performance, in particular for the common and consequential steps of model storage and inference. The RDBMS provides a natural starting point, given its mature infrastructure for fast data access and processing, along with support for enterprise features (e.g., encryption, auditing, high-availability). To take advantage of all of the above, we need to address a key concern: Can in-RDBMS scoring of ML models match (outperform?) the performance of dedicated frameworks? We answer the above positively by building Raven, a system that leverages native integration of ML runtimes (i.e., ONNX Runtime) deep within SQL Server, and a unified intermediate representation (IR) to enable advanced cross-optimizations between ML and DB operators. In this optimization space, we discover the most exciting research opportunities that combine DB/Compiler/ML thinking. Our initial evaluation on real data demonstrates performance gains of up to 5.5x from the native integration of ML in SQL Server, and up to 24x from cross-optimizations--we will demonstrate Raven live during the conference talk.",

            "abstract": "The back-end database is pivotal to the storage of the massive size of big data Internet exchanges stemming from cloud-hosted web applications to Internet of Things (IoT) smart devices. Structured Query Language (SQL) Injection Attack (SQLIA) remains an intruder's exploit of choice on vulnerable web applications to pilfer confidential data from the database with potentially damaging consequences. The existing solutions of mostly signature approaches were all before the recent challenges of big data mining and at such lacks the functionality and ability to cope with new signatures concealed in web requests. An alternative Machine Learning (ML) predictive analytics provides a functional and scalable mining to big data in detection and prevention of SQLIA. Unfortunately, lack of availability of readymade robust corpus or data set with patterns and historical data items to train a classifier are issues well known in SQLIA research. In this paper, we explore the generation of data set containing extraction from known attack patterns including SQL tokens and symbols present at injection points. Also, as a test case, we build a web application that expects dictionary word list as vector variables to demonstrate massive quantities of learning data. The data set is pre-processed, labelled and feature hashing for supervised learning. The trained classifier to be deployed as a web service that is consumed in a custom dot NET application implementing a web proxy Application Programming Interface (API) to intercept and accurately predict SQLIA in web requests thereby preventing malicious web requests from reaching the protected back-end database. This paper demonstrates a full proof of concept implementation of an ML predictive analytics and deployment of resultant web service that accurately predicts and prevents SQLIA with empirical evaluations presented in Confusion Matrix (CM) and Receiver Operating Curve (ROC).",

The management of a semi-structured data format for big data is an important concern that must be addressed. Most relational database management systems fail to handle the scalability and flexibility of big data. NoSQL, which is a new concept in database technology, offers support a large volume of data, thereby providing a good data storage and retrieval mechanism. However, NoSQL has no standard data modeling method. The important properties in handling the database relationships need to be considered in NoSQL data modeling. This study proposes a document-oriented data model for big data and then applies this model to migrate relational database applications to NoSQL on the basis of the properties of the ER model.",

            "abstract": "Outsourcing database to clouds is a scalable and cost-effective way for large scale data storage, management, and query processing. Trajectory data contain rich spatio-temporal relationships and reveal many forms of individual sensitive information (e.g., home address, health condition), which necessitate them to be encrypted before being outsourced for privacy concerns. However, efficient query processing over encrypted trajectory data is a very challenging task. Though some achievements have been reported very recently for simple queries (e.g., SQL queries, kNN queries) on encrypted data, there is rather limited progress on secure evaluation of trajectory queries because they are more complex and need special treatment. In this paper, we focus on secure trajectory similarity computation that is the cornerstone of secure trajectory query processing. More specifically, we propose an efficient solution to securely compute the similarity between two encrypted trajectories, which reveals nothing about the trajectories, but the final result. We theoretically prove that our solution is secure against the semi-honest adversaries model as all the intermediate information in our protocols can be simulated in polynomial time. Finally we empirically study the efficiency of the proposed method, which demonstrates the feasibility of our solution.",
