            "abstract": "With the rapid evolution of the Internet, Internet of Things (IoT), and geographic information systems (GIS), spatio-temporal Big Data (STBD) is experiencing exponential growth, marking the onset of the STBD era. Recent studies have concentrated on developing algorithms and techniques for the collection, management, storage, processing, analysis, and visualization of STBD. Researchers have made significant advancements by enhancing STBD handling techniques, creating novel systems, and integrating spatio-temporal support into existing systems. However, these studies often neglect resource management and system optimization, crucial factors for enhancing the efficiency of STBD processing and applications. Additionally, the transition of STBD to the innovative Cloud-Edge-End unified computing system needs to be noticed. In this survey, we comprehensively explore the entire ecosystem of STBD analytics systems. We delineate the STBD analytics ecosystem and categorize the technologies used to process GIS data into five modules: STBD, computation resources, processing platform, resource management, and applications. Specifically, we subdivide STBD and its applications into geoscience-oriented and human-social activity-oriented. Within the processing platform module, we further categorize it into the data management layer (DBMS-GIS), data processing layer (BigData-GIS), data analysis layer (AI-GIS), and cloud native layer (Cloud-GIS). The resource management module and each layer in the processing platform are classified into three categories: task-oriented, resource-oriented, and cloud-based. Finally, we propose research agendas for potential future developments.",

            "abstract": "The growing importance of data analytics is leading to a shift in data management strategy at many companies, moving away from simple data storage towards adopting Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) query analysis. Concurrently, NoSQL databases are gaining ground as the preferred choice for storing and querying analytical data. This article presents a comprehensive, systematic mapping, aiming to consolidate research efforts related to the integration of OLAP with NoSQL databases in Big Data environments. After identifying 1646 initial research studies from scientific digital repositories, a thorough examination of their content resulted in the acceptance of 22 studies. Utilizing the snowballing technique, an additional three studies were selected, culminating in a final corpus of twenty-five relevant articles. This review addresses the growing importance of leveraging NoSQL databases for OLAP query analysis in response to increasing data analytics demands. By identifying the most commonly used NoSQL databases with OLAP, such as column-oriented and document-oriented, prevalent OLAP modeling methods, such as Relational Online Analytical Processing (ROLAP) and Multidimensional Online Analytical Processing (MOLAP), and suggested models for batch and real-time processing, among other results, this research provides a roadmap for organizations navigating the integration of OLAP with NoSQL. Additionally, exploring computational resource requirements and performance benchmarks facilitates informed decision making and promotes advancements in Big Data analytics. The main findings of this review provide valuable insights and updated information regarding the integration of OLAP cubes with NoSQL databases to benefit future research, industry practitioners, and academia alike. This consolidation of research efforts not only promotes innovative solutions but also promises reduced operational costs compared to traditional database systems.",

            "abstract": "Data lakes are a fundamental building block for many industrial data analysis solutions and becoming increasingly popular in research. Often associated with big data use cases, data lakes are, for example, used as central data management systems of research institutions or as the core entity of machine learning pipelines. The basic underlying idea of retaining data in its native format within a data lake facilitates a large range of use cases and improves data reusability, especially when compared to the schema-on-write approach applied in data warehouses, where data is transformed prior to the actual storage to fit a predefined schema. Storing such massive amounts of raw data, however, has its very own challenges, spanning from the general data modeling, and indexing for concise querying to the integration of suitable and scalable compute capabilities. In this contribution, influential papers of the last decade have been selected to provide a comprehensive overview of developments and obtained results. The papers are analyzed with regard to the applicability of their input to data lakes that serve as central data management systems of research institutions. To achieve this, contributions to data lake architectures, metadata models, data provenance, workflow support, and FAIR principles are investigated. Last, but not least, these capabilities are mapped onto the requirements of two common research personae to identify open challenges. With that, potential research topics are determined, which have to be tackled toward the applicability of data lakes as central building blocks for research data management.",

One of the important criteria when choosing a NoSQL database for an application is its performance in terms of speed of data accessing and processing, including response times to the most important CRUD operations (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE). In this paper, the behavior of two of the major document-based NoSQL databases, MongoDB and document-based MySQL, was analyzed in terms of the complexity and performance of CRUD operations, especially in query operations. The main objective of the paper is to make a comparative analysis of the impact that each specific database has on application performance when realizing CRUD requests. To perform this analysis, a case-study application was developed using the two document-based MongoDB and MySQL databases, which aim to model and streamline the activity of service providers that use a lot of data. The results obtained demonstrate the performance of both databases for different volumes of data; based on these, a detailed analysis and several conclusions were presented to support a decision for choosing an appropriate solution that could be used in a big-data application.",

            "abstract": "In the age of the Internet of Things and social media platforms, huge amounts of digital data are generated by and collected from many sources, including sensors, mobile devices, wearable trackers and security cameras. This data, commonly referred to as Big Data, is challenging current storage, processing, and analysis capabilities. New models, languages, systems and algorithms continue to be developed to effectively collect, store, analyze and learn from Big Data. Most of the recent surveys provide a global analysis of the tools that are used in the main phases of Big Data management (generation, acquisition, storage, querying and visualization of data). Differently, this work analyzes and reviews parallel and distributed paradigms, languages and systems used today to analyze and learn from Big Data on scalable computers. In particular, we provide an in-depth analysis of the properties of the main parallel programming paradigms (MapReduce, workflow, BSP, message passing, and SQL-like) and, through programming examples, we describe the most used systems for Big Data analysis (e.g., Hadoop, Spark, and Storm). Furthermore, we discuss and compare the different systems by highlighting the main features of each of them, their diffusion (community of developers and users) and the main advantages and disadvantages of using them to implement Big Data analysis applications. The final goal of this work is to help designers and developers in identifying and selecting the best/appropriate programming solution based on their skills, hardware availability, application domains and purposes, and also considering the support provided by the developer community.",

            "abstract": "The Resource Description Framework (RDF) represents a main ingredient and data representation format for Linked Data and the Semantic Web. It supports a generic graph-based data model and data representation format for describing things, including their relationships with other things. As the size of RDF datasets is growing fast, RDF data management systems must be able to cope with growing amounts of data. Even though physically handling RDF data using a relational table is possible, querying a giant triple table becomes very expensive because of the multiple nested joins required for answering graph queries. In addition, the heterogeneity of RDF Data poses entirely new challenges to database systems. This article provides a comprehensive study of the state of the art in handling and querying RDF data. In particular, we focus on data storage techniques, indexing strategies, and query execution mechanisms. Moreover, we provide a classification of existing systems and approaches. We also provide an overview of the various benchmarking efforts in this context and discuss some of the open problems in this domain.",

            "abstract": "The healthcare industry is different from other industries\u2013patient data are sensitive, their storage needs to be handled with care and in compliance with regulative, while prediction accuracy needs to be high. This fast expansion in medical image modalities and data collection leads to generation of so called \u201cBig Data\u201d which is time-consuming to be analyzed by medical experts. This paper provides an insight into the Big Data from the aspect of its role in multiscale modelling. Special attention is paid to the workflow, starting from medical image processing all the way to creation of personalized models and their analysis. A review of literature regarding Big Data in healthcare is provided and two proposed solutions are described\u2013carotid artery ultrasound image processing and 3D reconstruction, and drug testing on personalized heart models. Related to the carotid artery ultrasound image processing, the starting point is ultrasound images, which are segmented using convolutional neural network U-net, while segmented masks were further used in 3D reconstruction of geometry. Related to the drug testing on personalized heart model, similar approach was proposed, images were used in creation of personalized 3D geometrical model that is used in computational modelling to determine pressure in the left ventricle before and after drug testing. All the aforementioned methodologies are complex, include Big Data analysis and should be performed using servers or high-performance computing. Future development of Big Data applications in healthcare domains offers a lot of potential due to new data standards, rapid development of research and technology, as well as strong government incentives.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to identify and analyse the interactions among various enablers which are critical to the success of big data initiatives in operations and supply chain management (OSCM).,Fourteen enablers of big data in OSCM have been selected from literature and consequent deliberations with experts from industry. Three different multi criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques, namely, interpretive structural modeling (ISM), fuzzy total interpretive structural modeling (fuzzy-TISM) and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) have been used to identify driving enablers. Further, common enablers from each technique, their hierarchies and inter-relationships have been established.,The enabler modelings using ISM, Fuzzy-TISM and DEMATEL shows that the top management commitment, financial support for big data initiatives, big data/data science skills, organizational structure and change management program are the most influential/driving enablers. Across all three different techniques, these five different enablers has been identified as the most promising ones to implement big data in OSCM. On the other hand, interpretability of analysis, big data quality management, data capture and storage and data security and privacy have been commonly identified across all three different modeling techniques as the most dependent big data enablers for OSCM.,The MCDM models of big data enablers have been formulated based on the inputs from few domain experts and may not reflect the opinion of whole practitioners community.,The findings enable the decision makers to appropriately choose the desired and drop undesired enablers in implementing the big data initiatives to improve the performance of OSCM. The most common driving big data enablers can be given high priority over others and can significantly enhance the performance of OSCM.,MCDM-based hierarchical models and causal diagram for big data enablers depicting contextual inter-relationships has been proposed which is a new effort for implementation of big data in OSCM.",

To address such issues, the proposed approach involves using the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for data processing, the map-reduce programming paradigm for data processing, and query optimization techniques to quickly and effectively extract accurate outcomes from a variety of options with a high processing capacity. The methodology proposed in this work makes use of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for data clustering and the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) for optimization. The security of preprocessed data stored on networked clusters with interconnections has been ensured by SHA algorithms.\u00a0Finally, incorporating into consideration the important parameters, evaluation findings for the experimental performance of the model in the indicated methodology are produced. For this work, the estimated range of input file sizes is 60\u2013100\u00a0MB. The processing of 100\u00a0MB of input files yielded an accuracy of 96% and results for specificity and sensitivity of 90% and 93%, respectively. The outcomes have been compared with well-known methods like fuzzy C-means and K-means approaches, and the results show that the proposed method effectively distributes accurate data processing to cluster nodes with low latency. Moreover, it uses the least amount of memory resources possible when operating on functional CPUs. As a result, the proposed approach outperforms existing techniques.",

            "abstract": "Querying and reporting from large volumes of structured, semistructured, and unstructured data often requires some flexibility. This flexibility provided by fuzzy sets allows for categorization of the surrounding world in a flexible, human-mind-like manner. Apache Hive is a data warehousing framework working on top of the Hadoop platform for big data processing. Hive allows executing queries and aggregating and analyzing data stored in Hadoop distributed file system and other repositories. Hive responds to the current needs for efficient big data warehousing, which is impossible with traditional data warehouses due to their rigid nature. This article presents the FuzzyHive library that extends the Hive framework with fuzzy sets based techniques for querying, analyzing, and reporting on big data warehouses. We formalize the fuzzy techniques used while operating on Hive-based data warehouses (including fuzzy filtering on dimensional attributes, projection with fuzzy transformation, fuzzy grouping, and joining). We also show how we embedded these operations in Hive query language, which was not studied so far. Such extensions make big data warehousing more flexible and contribute to the portfolio of tools used by the community of people working with fuzzy sets and data analysis. The FuzzyHive library complements the spectrum of available solutions for fuzzy data processing and querying in large datasets. We investigate Hive fuzzy querying performance, effectiveness, and scalability for various data storage formats (text, Avro, and Parquet). Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed extensions introduce more elasticity and are also efficient for big data warehousing, which is the first such kind of solution for this environment.",

            "abstract": "Precision agriculture in the realm of the Internet of Things is characterized by the collection of data from multiple sensors deployed on the farm. These data present a spatial, temporal, and semantic characterization, which further complicates the performance in the management and implementation of models and repositories. In turn, the lack of standards is reflected in insufficient interoperability between management solutions and other non-native services in the framework.\u00a0In this paper, an innovative system for spatio-temporal semantic data management is proposed. It includes a data query system that allows farmers and users to solve queries daily, as well as feed decision-making, monitoring, and task automation solutions. In the proposal, a solution is provided to ensure service interoperability and is validated against two European smart farming platforms, namely AFarCloud and DEMETER. For the evaluation and validation of the proposed framework, a neural network is implemented, fed through STSDaMaS for training and validation, to provide accurate forecasts for the harvest and baling of forage legume crops for livestock feeding. As a result of the evaluation for the training and execution of neural networks, high performance on complex spatio-temporal semantic queries is exposed. The paper concludes with a distributed framework for managing complex spatio-temporal semantic data by offering service interoperability through data integration to external agricultural data models.

            "abstract": "Network Operators are shifting their business interest towards Data services in a geometric progression manner, as Data services is becoming the major source of Telco revenue. The wide use of Data platforms; such as WhatsApp, Skype, Hangout and other Over the Top (OTT) voice applications over the traditional voice services is a clear indication that Network Operators need to adjust their business model and needs. And couple with the adoption of Smartphones usage which grows continuously year by year, this means more subscribers to manage, large amount of transactions generated, more network resources to be added and evidently more human technical expertise required to ensure good service quality. That has led to high investment on Robust Service Quality Management (SQM) and Customer Experience Management (CEM) to stay competitive in the market. The high investment is justified by the integration of Big Data Solutions, Machine Learning capabilities and good visualization of insight data. However, the Return on Investment (ROI) of the expensive systems are not as conspicuous as the provided functionalities and business rules. Therefore, in this paper an efficient model for low cost SQM system is presented, exploring the advantages of In-Memory Big Data processing and low cost business Intelligence tools to showcase how a good Service Quality Management can be implemented with no big investment.",

            "abstract": "\n Modern digital life has produced big data in modern businesses and organizations. To derive information for decision-making from these enormous data sets, a lot of work is required at several levels. The storage, transmission, processing, mining, and serving of big data create problems for digital domains. Despite several efforts to implement big data in businesses, basic issues with big data remain (particularly big-data management (BDM)). Cloud computing, for example, provides companies with well-suited, cost-effective, and consistent on-demand services for big data and analytics. This paper introduces the modern systems for organizational BDM. This article analyzes the latest research to manage organization-generated data using cloud computing. The findings revealed several benefits in integrating big data and cloud computing, the most notable of which is increased company efficiency and improved international trade. This study also highlighted some hazards in the sophisticated computing environment. Cloud computing has the potential to improve corporate management and accountants' jobs significantly. This article's major contribution is to discuss the demands, advantages, and problems of using big data and cloud computing in contemporary businesses and institutions.",

Based on true characteristics of TCM data, this strategy could solve the problems of the uncertainty of data object attributes in TCM information and the non-uniformity of the data representation by using modeless properties of stored objects in big data technology. Hybrid indexing mode was also used to solve the conflicts brought by different storage modes in indexing process, with powerful capabilities in query processing of massive data through efficient parallel MapReduce process. The theoretical analysis provided the management framework and its key technology, while its performance was tested on Hadoop by using several common traditional Chinese medicines and prescriptions from practical TCM data source. Result showed that this strategy can effectively solve the storage problem of TCM information, with good performance in query efficiency, completeness and robustness.",

            "abstract": "These last years we have been witnessing a tremendous growth in the volume and availability of data. This fact results primarily from the emergence of a multitude of sources (e.g. computers, mobile devices, sensors or social networks) that are continuously producing either structured, semi-structured or unstructured data. Database Management Systems and Data Warehouses are no longer the only technologies used to store and analyze datasets, namely due to the volume and complex structure of nowadays data that degrade their performance and scalability. Big Data is one of the recent challenges, since it implies new requirements in terms of data storage, processing and visualization. Despite that, analyzing properly Big Data can constitute great advantages because it allows discovering patterns and correlations in datasets. Users can use this processed information to gain deeper insights and to get business advantages. Thus, data modeling and data analytics are evolved in a way that we are able to process huge amounts of data without compromising performance and availability, but instead by \u201crelaxing\u201d the usual ACID properties. This paper provides a broad view and discussion of the current state of this subject with a particular focus on data modeling and data analytics, describing and clarifying the main differences between the three main approaches in what concerns these aspects, namely: operational databases, decision support databases and Big Data technologies.",

            "abstract": "With the development of positioning technology, a large number of trajectories have been generated, which are very useful for many urban applications. However, it is challenging to manage trajectory data for its spatio-temporal dynamics and high-volume properties. Existing trajectory data management frameworks suffer from efficiency or scalability problem, and support only limited trajectory query types. This paper takes the first attempt to build a holistic distributed NoSQL trajectory query engine, named TrajMesa, based on GeoMesa, an open-source indexing toolkit for spatio-temporal data. TrajMesa can manage a prohibitively large number of trajectories, and support plenty of query types efficiently. Specifically, we first design a novel trajectory storage schema, which reduces the storage size tremendously. We then devise a novel indexing key schema for time ranges, based on which ID (i.e., moving object identifier) temporal query can be supported efficiently. To reduce the amount of retrieved trajectory data for a spatial range query, we propose a position code to indicate the spatial location of trajectories accurately. We also propose a bunch of pruning strategies for similarity query and <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"li-ieq1-3079880.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula>-NN query in the NoSQL environment. Extensive experiments are conducted using two real datasets and one synthetic dataset, verifying the powerful query efficiency and scalability of TrajMesa. The results show that TrajMesa is about <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$100 \\sim 1000$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mn>100</mml:mn><mml:mo>\u223c</mml:mo><mml:mn>1000</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"li-ieq2-3079880.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> times faster than the state-of-the-art trajectory management frameworks in our experimental settings. TrajMesa is currently deployed in JD company, processing over 1T trajectories of JD Logistics every day.",

            "abstract": "Modern data-parallel systems such as Spark rely increasingly on in-memory computing that can significantly improve the efficiency of iterative algorithms. To process real-world datasets, modern data-parallel systems often require extremely large amounts of memory, which are both costly and energy-inefficient. Emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies offers high capacity compared to DRAM and low energy compared to SSDs. Hence, NVMs have the potential to fundamentally change the dichotomy between DRAM and durable storage in Big Data processing. However, most Big Data applications are written in managed languages (e.g., Scala and Java) and executed on top of a managed runtime (e.g., the Java Virtual Machine) that already performs various dimensions of memory management. Supporting hybrid physical memories adds in a new dimension, creating unique challenges in data replacement and migration. This paper proposes Panthera, a semantics-aware, fully automated memory management technique for Big Data processing over hybrid memories. Panthera analyzes user programs on a Big Data system to infer their coarse-grained access patterns, which are then passed down to the Panthera runtime for efficient data placement and migration. For Big Data applications, the coarse-grained data division is accurate enough to guide GC for data layout, which hardly incurs data monitoring and moving overhead. We have implemented Panthera in OpenJDK and Apache Spark. An extensive evaluation with various datasets and applications demonstrates that Panthera reduces energy by 32 \u2013 52% at only a 1 \u2013 9% execution time overhead.",

Traditional database system such as PostgreSQL/PostGIS to cope with this demand. Meanwhile, distributed trajectory management systems based on NoSQL have attracted increasing attention from both industry and acdemia. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are not many reseach discussing the comparision of these systems. This paper aiming at filling this gap by comparing the performance of the representitive relational database component PostGIS and the distributed NoSQL data management system GeoMesa in various range query and multi concurrent access scenarios through experimental analysis. The experimental results show that GeoMesa outperforms the relational spatial database component PostGIS in the large number of access results and multi-user access scenarios.",

A critical analysis of two big data processing platforms, Apache Hadoop MapReduce and Apache Spark, has been done in this paper. Earlier Hadoop MapReduce was one of the most popular platforms for batch-processing of huge size datasets but variation in the nature of data from static to dynamic, Apache Spark proves to be better for iterative jobs and live data streams. This paper aims to critically compare and analyze Hadoop-l.x, 2. x and 3. x, Spark-l.x, 2. x and 3. x on well-known key parameters like components, storage system, resource management, fault tolerance, data processing, scalability and performance etc.",

            "abstract": "Industry 4.0 aims to transform chemical and biochemical processes into intelligent systems via the integration of digital components with the actual physical units involved. This process can be thought of as addition of a central nervous system with a sensing and control monitoring of components and regulating the performance of the individual physical assets (processes, units, etc.) involved. Established technologies central to the digital integrating components are smart sensing, mobile communication, Internet of Things, modelling and simulation, advanced data processing, storage and analysis, advanced process control, artificial intelligence and machine learning, cloud computing, and virtual and augmented reality. An essential element to this transformation is the exploitation of large amounts of historical process data and large volumes of data generated in real-time by smart sensors widely used in industry. Exploitation of the information contained in these data requires the use of advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies integrated with more traditional modelling techniques. The purpose of this paper is twofold: a) to present the state-of-the-art of the aforementioned technologies, and b) to present a strategic plan for their integration toward the goal of an autonomous smart plant capable of self-adaption and self-regulation for short- and long-term production management.",

            "abstract": "Growing main memory capacity has fueled the development of in-memory big data management and processing. By eliminating disk I/O bottleneck, it is now possible to support interactive data analytics. However, in-memory systems are much more sensitive to other sources of overhead that do not matter in traditional I/O-bounded disk-based systems. Some issues such as fault-tolerance and consistency are also more challenging to handle in in-memory environment. We are witnessing a revolution in the design of database systems that exploits main memory as its data storage layer. Many of these researches have focused along several dimensions: modern CPU and memory hierarchy utilization, time/space efficiency, parallelism, and concurrency control. In this survey, we aim to provide a thorough review of a wide range of in-memory data management and processing proposals and systems, including both data storage systems and data processing frameworks. We also give a comprehensive presentation of important technology in memory management, and some key factors that need to be considered in order to achieve efficient in-memory data management and processing.",

Elasticity of resources in the cloud enables application providers to achieve results in terms of complexity, performance and availability that were considered beyond affordability, by means of proper resource management techniques and a savvy design of the underlying architecture and of communication facilities. This paper presents an evaluation technique for the combined effects of cloud elasticity and Big Data oriented data management layer on global scale cloud applications, by modeling the behavior of both typical in memory and in storage data management.",

            "abstract": "Online analytical processing (OLAP) approach is widely used in business intelligence to cater the multidimensional queries for decades. In this era of cutting-edge technology and the internet, data generation rates have been rising exponentially. Internet of things sensors and social media platforms are some of the major contributors, leading toward the absolute data boom. Storage and speed are the crucial parameters and undoubtedly the burning issues in efficient data handling. The key idea here is to address these two challenges of big data computing in OLAP. In this article, the authors have proposed and implemented OLAP on Hadoop by Indexing (OOHI). OOHI offers a simplified multidimensional model that stores dimensions in the schema server and measures on the Hadoop cluster. Overall setup is divided into various modules, namely: data storage module (DSM), dimension encoding module (DEM), cube segmentation module, segment selection module (SSM), and block selection and process (BSAP) module. Serialization and deserialization concept applied by DSM for storage and retrieval of the data for efficient space utilization. Integer encoding adopted by DEM in dimension hierarchy is selected to escape sparsity problem in multidimensional big data. To reduce search space by chunks of the cube from the queried chunks, SSM plays an important role. Map reduce-based indexing approach and series of seek operations of BSAP module were integrated to achieve parallelism and fault tolerance. Real-time oceanography data and supermarket data sets are applied to demonstrate that OOHI model is data independent. Various test cases are designed to cover the scope of each dimension and volume of data set. Comparative results and performance analytics portray that OOHI outperforms in data storage, dice, slice, and roll-up operations compared with Hadoop based OLAP.",

Visualizing the extracted data for real-time solutions is demanding in accordance with the semantics and the classification employed by the processing models. This article introduces fuzzy-optimized data management (FDM) technique for classifying and improving coalition of accumulated information based semantics and constraints. The dependency of the information is classified on the basis of the relationships modeled between the data based on the attributes. This technique segregates the considered attributes based on similarity index boundaries to process complex data in a controlled time. The performance of the proposed FDM is analyzed using a real-time weather forecast dataset consisting of sensor data (observed) and image data (captured). With this dataset, the functions of FDM such as input semantics analytics and classification based on similarity are performed. The metrics classification and processing time and similarity index are analyzed for the varying data sizes, classification instances, and dataset records. The proposed FDM is found to achieve 36.28% less processing time for varying classification instances, and 12.57% high similarity index.",

            "abstract": "Distributed computing continuum systems (DCCS) make use of a vast number of computing devices to process data generated by edge devices such as the Internet of Things and sensor nodes. Besides performing computations, these devices also produce data including, for example, event logs, configuration files, network management information. When these data are analyzed, we can learn more about the devices, such as their capabilities, processing efficiency, resource usage, and failure prediction. However, these data are available in different forms and have different attributes due to the highly heterogeneous nature of DCCS. The diversity of data poses various challenges which we discuss by relating them to big data, so that we can utilize the advantages of big data analytical tools. We enumerate several existing tools that can perform the monitoring task and also summarize their characteristics. Further, we provide a general governance and sustainable architecture for DCCS, which reflects the human body\u2019s self-healing model. The proposed model has three stages: first, it analyzes system data to acquire knowledge; second, it can leverage the knowledge to monitor and predict future conditions; and third, it takes further actions to autonomously solve any issue or to alert administrators. Thus, the DCCS model is designed to minimize the system\u2019s downtime while optimizing resource usage. A small set of data is used to illustrate the monitoring and prediction of the performance of a system through Bayesian network structure learning. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the governance and sustainability model, and we provide possible solutions to overcome them and make the system more efficient.",

The area has witnessed a series of developments and technological advancements from its conventional structured database to the recent buzzword, bigdata. This paper aims to provide a complete model of a relational database that is still being widely used because of its well known ACID properties namely, atomicity, consistency, integrity and durability. Specifically, the objective of this paper is to highlight the adoption of relational model approaches by bigdata techniques. Towards addressing the reason for this in corporation, this paper qualitatively studied the advancements done over a while on the relational data model. First, the variations in the data storage layout are illustrated based on the needs of the application. Second, quick data retrieval techniques like indexing, query processing and concurrency control methods are revealed. The paper provides vital insights to appraise the efficiency of the structured database in the unstructured environment, particularly when both consistency and scalability become an issue in the working of the hybrid transactional and analytical database management system.",

            "abstract": "The enormous growth of the internet, enterprise applications, social media, and IoT devices in the current time caused a huge spike in enterprise data growth. Big data platform provided scalable storage to manage enterprise data growth and served easier data access to decision-makers, stakeholders and business users. It is a well-known challenge to classify, organize and store all this data and process it to provide business insights. Due to nature, variety, velocity, volume and value of data make it difficult to effectively process big data. Enterprises face challenges to apply complex business rules, to generate insights and to support data-driven decisions in a timely fashion. As big data lake integrates streams of data from a bunch of business units, stakeholders usually analyze enterprise-wide data from various data models. Data models are a vital component of Big data platform. Users may do complex processing, run queries and perform big table joins to generate required metrics depending on the available data models. It is usually a time consuming and resource-intensive process to find the value from data. It is a no-brainer that big data platform in the enterprise needs high-quality data modeling methods to reach an optimal mix of cost, performance, and quality. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing an effective and scalable way to organize and store data in Big Data Lake. It presents some of the basic principles and methodology to build scalable data models in a distributed environment. It also describes how it overcomes common challenges and presents findings.",

            "abstract": "Big Data is a rapidly evolving and maturing field which places significant data storage and processing power at our disposal. To take advantage of this power, we need to create new means of collecting and processing large volumes of data at high speed. Meanwhile, as companies and organizations, such as health services, realize the importance and value of \"joined-up thinking\" across supply chains and healthcare pathways, for example, this creates a demand for a new type of approach to Business Activity Monitoring and Management. This new approach requires Big Data solutions to cope with the volume and speed of transactions across global supply chains. In this paper we describe a methodology and framework to leverage Big Data and Analytics to deliver a Decision Support framework to support Business Process Improvement, using near real-time process analytics in a decision-support environment. The system supports the capture and analysis of hierarchical process data, allowing analysis to take place at different organizational and process levels. Individual business units can perform their own process monitoring. An event-correlation mechanism is built into the system, allowing the monitoring of individual process instances or paths.",

            "abstract": "Big-data systems are increasingly important for solving the data-driven problems in many science domains including geosciences. However, existing big-data systems cannot support the self-describing data formats such as NetCDF which are commonly used by scientific communities for data distribution and sharing. This limitation presents a serious hurdle to the further adoption of big-data systems by science domains and prevents scientific users from leveraging these systems to improve their productivity. This paper presents a solution to this problem by enabling big-data systems to directly store and process scientific data. Specifically, it enables Hadoop to efficiently store NetCDF data on HDFS and process them in MapReduce using convenient APIs. It also enables Hive to support standard queries on NetCDF data, transparently to users. The paper also presents an evaluation of the proposed solution using several representative queries on a typical geoscientific dataset. The results show that the proposed approach achieves substantial speedup (up to 20 times) and space saving (83% reduction), compared to the traditional approach which has to convert NetCDF data to CSV format for Hadoop and Hive to use them.",

            "abstract": "Developments in information technology and its prevalent growth in several areas of business, engineering, medical, and scientific studies are resulting in information as well as data explosion. Knowledge discovery and decision making from such rapidly growing voluminous data are a challenging task in terms of data organization and processing, which is an emerging trend known as big data computing. Big data has gained much attention from the academia and the IT industry. A new paradigm that combines large-scale compute, new data-intensive techniques, and mathematical models to build data analytics. Thus, this chapter discusses the background of big data. It also discusses the various application of big data in detail. The various related work and the future direction would be addressed in this chapter.",

            "abstract": "With the fast development of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies, IoT big data and its applications are getting more and more useful. However, traditional IoT data management is fragile and vulnerable. Once the gathered data are untrusted or the stored data are tampered with deliberately from the internal users or attacked by an external hacker, then the tampered data have a serious problem to be utilized. To solve the problems of trust and security of IoT big data management, in this article, we propose a permissioned blockchain-based decentralized trust management and secure usage control scheme of IoT big data (called BlockBDM), upon which all the data operations and management, such as data gathering, invoking, transfer, storage, and usage, are processed over the blockchain smart contract. To encourage the IoT client to supply high-quality content, in our scheme, we design public-blockchain-based tokens reward mechanism for the high-quality data supply contribution. All the data processing and usage procedure can be recorded in a cryptography-signed and Merkle tree-based transaction(s) and block(s) with high-level security in a global and distributed ledger with tamper resistance. For data utilization and consumption, we propose secure usage control for digital rights management and token-based data consumption approach of high-value data from being violated or spread without any limitation. We implemented the BlockBDM scheme based on public and permissioned blockchain for IoT big data management. Finally, a large amount of evaluation manifests that the proposed BlockBDM scheme is feasible, secure, and scalable for decentralized trust management of IoT big data.",

            "abstract": "The demand for data storage and processing is increasing at a rapid speed in the big data era. Such a tremendous amount of data pushes the limit on storage capacity and on the storage network. A significant portion of the dataset in big data workloads is redundant. As a result, deduplication technology, which removes replicas, becomes an attractive solution to save disk space and traffic in a big data environment. However, the overhead of extra CPU computation (hash indexing) and IO latency introduced by deduplication should be considered. Therefore, the net effect of using deduplication for big data workloads needs to be examined. To this end, we characterize the redundancy of typical big data workloads to justify the need for deduplication. We analyze and characterize the performance and energy impact brought by deduplication under various big data environments. In our experiments, we identify three sources of redundancy in big data workloads: 1) deploying more nodes, 2) expanding the dataset, and 3) using replication mechanisms. We elaborate on the advantages and disadvantages of different deduplication layers, locations, and granularities. In addition, we uncover the relation between energy overhead and the degree of redundancy. Furthermore, we investigate the deduplication efficiency in an SSD environment for big data workloads.",

            "abstract": "Adopting the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model, this study aims at investigating the impact of big data (volume, velocity, variety, veracity, and value) on supply chain performance through the mediating role of supply chain management (plan, source, make, deliver, and return) assuming four hypotheses. Data were collected using a questionnaire from managers of food processing companies. The results showed that big data affected supply chain management significantly and positively, which in turn affected supply chain performance significantly and positively. In addition, big data exerted a significant and positive impact on supply chain performance. Based on these links, it was found that supply chain management mediated significantly the effect of big data on supply chain performance. The study contributes to the literature showing that big data plays a pivotal role in improving supply chain performance and supply chain performance from the SCOR model perspective is critical for the relationship between these two constructs.",

The direct output of these 'dirty data' will seriously affect the accuracy and efficiency of data decision-making. It can lead to incomprehensible results. Therefore, data cleaning of raw data is a key link in the process of big data analysis and application. This article elaborates on the overview and classification of data quality, the principle and basic process of data cleaning, and the methods of data cleaning [1].",

            "abstract": "With the increasing interconnection of smart sensors in long-term care facilities, the amount of data available for multi-modal Big Data analytics is advantageous. Using raw smart sensor data, researchers can derive and extract physiological features useful for health monitoring. Nonetheless, with the immense amount of smart sensor data, the ability to utilize these data for multi-modal analytics as the data grows presents a great challenge for researchers and long-term care facilities. This paper proposes a database design system for multi-modal derived time-series featured data (respiration and restlessness) by using techniques such as hierarchical time-indexed databases and dense numerical array storage. We present evaluations and findings for our proposed database system design for multi-modal time-series feature data to assess the various performance characteristics in data access time, storage, and usability; demonstrating an extremely scalable design and simple integration with existing analytic tools via SQL interfaces. Furthermore, we introduce a data-processing pipeline enabling Big Data analytics for multi-modal time-series feature data.",

In this study, we introduce ScienceEarth, a cluster-based data processing framework. The aim of ScienceEarth is to store, manage, and process large-scale remote sensing data in a cloud-based cluster-computing environment. The platform consists of the following three main parts: ScienceGeoData, ScienceGeoIndex, and ScienceGeoSpark. ScienceGeoData stores and manages remote sensing data. ScienceGeoIndex is an index and query system, a spatial index based on quad-tree and Hilbert curve which is combined for heterogeneous tiled remote sensing data that makes efficient data retrieval in ScienceGeoData. ScienceGeoSpark is an easy-to-use computing framework in which we use Apache Spark as the analytics engine for big remote sensing data processing. The result of tests proves that ScienceEarth can efficiently store, retrieve, and process remote sensing data. The results reveal ScienceEarth has the potential and capabilities of efficient big remote sensing data processing.",

            "abstract": "This study sought to investigate the impacts of big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and business intelligence (BI) on Firms' e-learning and business performance at Jordanian telecommunications industry. After the samples were checked, a total of 269 were collected. All of the information gathered throughout the investigation was analyzed using the PLS software. The results show a network of interconnections can improve both e-learning and corporate effectiveness. This research concluded that the integration of big data, AI, and BI has a positive impact on e-learning infrastructure development and organizational efficiency. The findings indicate that big data has a positive and direct impact on business performance, including Big Data External and Internal, Innovative Usage, Indexing, and Sources Accuracy. In addition, Artificial intelligence positively affects business performance, including Data Accuracy, Data Transparency, Data Speed, and Creative Thinking and Learning. Moreover, business intelligence has a direct and positive impact on business performance, including Data Warehouse, Data Mining, Business Process Management, and Competitive Intelligence. In addition, the findings indicate that e-learning which represents system quality, information quality, and self-efficacy has a positive relationship on enhancing business performance. Interestingly, the present findings are inconsistent with those of previous studies showing the variables of interest which have no effect on e-learning and business performance. Taken together, the findings of this study suggest that firms should begin to apply processes related with applying e-learning and developing business performance. The novelty of the present study lies in highlighting the key dimensions of big data, artificial intelligence, and business intelligence when it comes to enhancing e-learning and business performance at Jordanian telecommunications industry.",

            "abstract": "The efficiency of query processing is highly affected by execution plans and allocated resources in the Spark SQL big data processing engine. However, the cost models for Spark SQL are still based on hand-crafted rules. The learning-based cost models have been proposed for relational databases, but it does not consider the effect of the available resources. To address this, we propose a resource-aware deep learning model that can automatically predict the execution time of query plans based on historical data. To train our model, we embed the query execution plans based on the query plan tree and extract features from the allocated resources. A deep learning model with adaptive attention mechanisms is then trained to predict the execution time of query plans. The experiments show that our deep cost model can achieve higher accuracy in predicting the execution time of query plans compared to traditional rule-based methods and relational database learning-based optimizers.",

            "abstract": "Background Chronic disease management (CDM) falls under production relations, and digital technology belongs to the realm of productivity. Production relations must adapt to the development of productivity. Simultaneously, the prevalence and burden of chronic diseases are becoming increasingly severe, leveraging digital technology to innovate chronic disease management model is essential. Methods The model was built to cover experts in a number of fields, including administrative officials, public health experts, information technology staff, clinical experts, general practitioners, nurses, metrologists. Integration of multiple big data platforms such as General Practitioner Contract Platform, Integrated Community Multimorbidity Management System and Municipal and District-Level Health Information Comprehensive Platform. This study fully analyzes the organizational structure, participants, service objects, facilities and equipment, digital technology, operation process, etc., required for new model in the era of big data. Results Based on information technology, we build Integrated Community Multimorbidity Care Model (ICMCM). This model is based on big data, is driven by \u201ctechnology + mechanism,\u201d and uses digital technology as a tool to achieve the integration of services, technology integration, and data integration, thereby providing patients with comprehensive people-centered services. In order to promote the implementation of the ICMCM, Shanghai has established an integrated chronic disease management information system, clarified the role of each module and institution, and achieved horizontal and vertical integration of data and services. Moreover, we adopt standardized service processes and accurate blood pressure and blood glucose measurement equipment to provide services for patients and upload data in real time. On the basis of Integrated Community Multimorbidity Care Model, a platform and index system have been established, and the platform's multidimensional cross-evaluation and indicators are used for management and visual display. Conclusions The Integrated Community Multimorbidity Care Model guides chronic disease management in other countries and regions. We have utilized models to achieve a combination of services and management that provide a grip on chronic disease management.",

            "abstract": "The emergence of new hardware architectures, and the continuous production of data open new challenges for data management. It is no longer pertinent to reason with respect to a predefined set of resources (i.e., computing, storage and main memory). Instead, it is necessary to design data processing algorithms and processes considering unlimited resources via the \u201cpay-as-you-go\u201d model. According to this model, resources provision must consider the economic cost of the processes versus the use and parallel exploitation of available computing resources. In consequence, new methodologies, algorithms and tools for querying, deploying and programming data management functions have to be provided in scalable and elastic architectures that can cope with the characteristics of Big Data aware systems (intelligent systems, decision making, virtual environments, smart cities, drug personalization). These functions, must respect QoS properties (e.g., security, reliability, fault tolerance, dynamic evolution and adaptability) and behavior properties (e.g., transactional execution) according to application requirements. Mature and novel system architectures propose models and mechanisms for adding these properties to new efficient data management and processing functions delivered as services. This paper gives an overview of the different architectures in which efficient data management functions can be delivered for addressing Big Data processing challenges.",

            "abstract": "In the context of big data and the Internet of Things, with the advancement of geospatial data acquisition and retrieval, the volume of available geospatial data is increasing every minute. Thus, new data-management architecture is needed. We proposed a building information model (BIM) big data-storage-management solution with hybrid storage architecture based on web virtual reality geographical information system (WebVRGIS). BIM is associated with the integration of spatial and semantic information on the various stages of urban building. In this paper, based on the spatial distribution characteristics of BIM geospatial big data, a data storage and management model is proposed for BIM geospatial big data management. The architecture primarily includes Not only Structured Query Language (NoSQL) database and distributed peer-to-peer storage. The evaluation of the proposed storage method is conducted on the same software platform as our previous research about WebVR. The experimental results show that the hybrid storage architecture proposed in this research has a lower response time compared to the traditional relational database in geospatial big data searches. The integration and fusion of BIM big data in WebVRGIS realizes a revolutionary transformation of city information management during a full lifecycle. The system also has great promise for the storage of other geospatial big data, such as traffic data.",

            "abstract": "Decision\u2010making in flood risk management is increasingly dependent on access to data, with the availability of data increasing dramatically in recent years. We are therefore moving towards an era of big data, with the added challenges that, in this area, data sources are highly heterogeneous, at a variety of scales, and include a mix of structured and unstructured data. The key requirement is therefore one of integration and subsequent analyses of this complex web of data. This paper examines the potential of a data\u2010driven approach to support decision\u2010making in flood risk management, with the goal of investigating a suitable software architecture and associated set of techniques to support a more data\u2010centric approach. The key contribution of the paper is a cloud\u2010based data hypercube that achieves the desired level of integration of highly complex data. This hypercube builds on innovations in cloud services for data storage, semantic enrichment and querying, and also features the use of notebook technologies to support open and collaborative scenario analyses in support of decision making. The paper also highlights the success of our agile methodology in weaving together cross\u2010disciplinary perspectives and in engaging a wide range of stakeholders in exploring possible technological futures for flood risk management.",

            "abstract": "Provenance is a type of metadata that records the creation and transformation of data objects. It has been applied to a wide variety of areas such as security, search, and experimental documentation. However, provenance usually has a vast amount of data with its rapid growth rate which hinders the effective extraction and application of provenance. This paper proposes an efficient provenance management system via clustering and hybrid storage. Specifically, we propose a Provenance-Based Label Propagation Algorithm which is able to regularize and cluster a large number of irregular provenance. Then, we use separate physical storage mediums, such as SSD and HDD, to store hot and cold data separately, and implement a hot/cold scheduling scheme which can update and schedule data between them automatically. Besides, we implement a feedback mechanism which can locate and compress the rarely used cold data according to the query request. The experimental test shows that the system can significantly improve provenance query performance with a small run-time overhead.",

Advanced analytics are required to improve the reliability and repeatability of additive manufacturing, and those analytics require data. Large volumes of multimodal data are generated and used throughout the additive manufacturing lifecycle, from material design to part design and simulation, part printing to post-processing and inspection. To capture and link that diverse Big Data together, we have designed and developed a federated multimodal Big Data storage and analytics platform comprised of three tiers\u2014a distributed polyglot data storage and analysis tier with different repositories for different data structures, a metadata knowledge graph tier for modeling the data and their relationships across the various repositories, and a user interface tier for visualizing, exploring and invoking analytics on the data. The platform has been used to integrate a collection of previously disparate steps to optimize the process parameters used to build a new additive material, enabling materials scientists and other non-software experts to capture, visualize and analyze the requisite data through a single user interface.",

In this survey, we comprehensively review recent research trends in trajectory data management, ranging from trajectory pre-processing, storage, common trajectory analytic tools, such as querying spatial-only and spatial-textual trajectory data, and trajectory clustering. We also explore four closely related analytical tasks commonly used with trajectory data in interactive or real-time processing. Deep trajectory learning is also reviewed for the first time. Finally, we outline the essential qualities that a trajectory data management system should possess to maximize flexibility.",

            "abstract": "The proliferation of various items recommended by Internet-based systems has resulted in the exponential growth of the number of ratings in the big data era. Recent advances in matrix factorization have made it an effective way to process these ratings for recommendations. However, we confront a challenge in deploying a matrix factorization model for recommendations in big data that arises from the typically resource-constrained local devices regarding their storage space and computing capacity. This paper proposes a novel lightweight matrix factorization for recommendations. Our scheme deploys shard grandients training on user local internet of things(IoT) devices, which makes it possible for users to train big data model locally. We design a two-phase solution to protect the security of users\u2019 data and reduce the dimension of the items. Moreover, we optimize the proposed scheme by introducing a stabilization mechanism to decrease the scale of the perturbed gradients. Some experimental results are given with two real online datasets, MovieLens and LibimSeTi. The theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that compared with other methods, the proposed scheme achieves a good performance in terms of security, accuracy, and efficiency.",

            "abstract": "Big Data and machine learning (ML) technologies have the potential to impact many facets of environment and water management (EWM). Big Data are information assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety, and veracity. Fast advances in high-resolution remote sensing techniques, smart information and communication technologies, and social media have contributed to the proliferation of Big Data in many EWM fields, such as weather forecasting, disaster management, smart water and energy management systems, and remote sensing. Big Data brings about new opportunities for data-driven discovery in EWM, but it also requires new forms of information processing, storage, retrieval, as well as analytics. ML, a subdomain of artificial intelligence (AI), refers broadly to computer algorithms that can automatically learn from data. ML may help unlock the power of Big Data if properly integrated with data analytics. Recent breakthroughs in AI and computing infrastructure have led to the fast development of powerful deep learning (DL) algorithms that can extract hierarchical features from data, with better predictive performance and less human intervention. Collectively Big Data and ML techniques have shown great potential for data-driven decision making, scientific discovery, and process optimization. These technological advances may greatly benefit EWM, especially because (1) many EWM applications (e.g. early flood warning) require the capability to extract useful information from a large amount of data in autonomous manner and in real time, (2) EWM researches have become highly multidisciplinary, and handling the ever increasing data volume/types using the traditional workflow is simply not an option, and last but not least, (3) the current theoretical knowledge about many EWM processes is still incomplete, but which may now be complemented through data-driven discovery. A large number of applications on Big Data and ML have already appeared in the EWM literature in recent years. The purposes of this survey are to (1) examine the potential and benefits of data-driven research in EWM, (2) give a synopsis of key concepts and approaches in Big Data and ML, (3) provide a systematic review of current applications, and finally (4) discuss major issues and challenges, and recommend future research directions. EWM includes a broad range of research topics. Instead of attempting to survey each individual area, this review focuses on areas of nexus in EWM, with an emphasis on elucidating the potential benefits of increased data availability and predictive analytics to improving the EWM research.",

            "abstract": "Data-intensive queries are common in business intelligence, data warehousing and analytics applications. Typically, processing a query involves full inspection of large in-storage data sets by CPUs. An intuitive way to speed up such queries is to reduce the volume of data transferred over the storage network to a host system. This can be achieved by filtering out extraneous data within the storage, motivating a form of near-data processing. This work presents Biscuit, a novel near-data processing framework designed for modern solid-state drives. It allows programmers to write a data-intensive application to run on the host system and the storage system in a distributed, yet seamless manner. In order to offer a high-level programming model, Biscuit builds on the concept of data flow. Data processing tasks communicate through typed and data-ordered ports. Biscuit does not distinguish tasks that run on the host system and the storage system. As the result, Biscuit has desirable traits like generality and expressiveness, while promoting code reuse and naturally exposing concurrency. We implement Biscuit on a host system that runs the Linux OS and a high-performance solid-state drive. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and implementation with experimental results. When data filtering is done by hardware in the solid-state drive, the average speed-up obtained for the top five queries of TPC-H is over 15x.",

            "abstract": "The rapid development of digital technologies, IoT products and connectivity platforms, social networking applications, video, audio and geolocation services has created opportunities for collecting/accumulating a large amount of data. While in the past corporations used to deal with static, centrally stored data collected from various sources, with the birth of the web and cloud services, cloud computing is rapidly overtaking the traditional in-house system as a reliable, scalable and costeffective IT solution. The high volumes of structures and unstructured data, stored in a distributed manner, and the wide variety of data sources pose problems related to data/knowledge representation and integration, data querying, business analysis and knowledge discovery. This introductory chapter serves to characterize the relevant aspects of the Big Data Ecosystem with respect to big data characteristics, the components needed for implementing end-to-end big data processing and the need for using semantics for improving the data management, integration, processing, and analytical tasks.",

            "abstract": "The evolution and democratization of technologies have created a veritable explosion of information, this, of course, gives rise to an urgent need to analyze and deal with the huge masses of data. In fact, the problems raised by the accumulation of data (storage, processing time, heterogeneity, capture rate/generation, etc.) become stronger because the data are massive, complex and varied. It is clear that the representation of information has the capacity to synthesize and condense data, and constitutes an efficient approach for analysis. Nevertheless, it remains ineffective and does not solve these problems. Besides that, conventional visualization techniques are rarely adapted to manage and process this mass of information. To face the complex big data challenges, various types of technologies have been developed. This paper talks about the visualization layer. This layer is located just above the Data Sources, Ingestion, Hadoop storage and Hadoop Platform Management layers for which we have already proposed a meta-modeling. It has a very important role at the level of Big Data Structure. In a continuous effort, we shall present in this paper a universal meta-modeling for the visualization layer and its relationship with the other layers of a Big Data system.",

            "abstract": "Big data technologies have been growing up quickly during past years. New storage and computing solutions appear while those already established in the market are improved with new features and better performance. Along with this growth also rises the number of applications and fields where the inclusion of big data technologies provides a large number of benefits, from the reduction in computational costs and economic resources to the improvement in the quality of the services provided which has a direct impact on the customers satisfaction. LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data processing is one of the topics that could benefit from the adoption of these kind of technologies due to the massive datasets that are being gathered nowadays, with applications in archaeology, geography, geology or forestry, among many others. An efficient management of this volume of data becomes a key point especially in visualization, computing and analytic processes. In this paper, we analyse how web applications for the visualization of LiDAR data can benefit from the adoption of big data storage technologies, as well as the advantages and disadvantages that may determine the choice of one of them.",

In this paper, a novel approach for big data processing and management was proposed that differed from the existing ones; the proposed method employs not only the memory space to reads and handle big data, it also uses space of memory-mapped extended from memory storage. From a methodological viewpoint, the novelty of this paper is the segmentation stage of big data using memory mapping and broadcasting all segments to a number of processors using a parallel message passing interface. From an application viewpoint, the paper presents a high-performance approach based on a homogenous network which works parallelly to encrypt-decrypt big data using AES algorithm. This approach can be done on Windows Operating System using .NET libraries.",

            "abstract": "Big data are in the midst of many scientific and economic issues. Furthermore, their volume is continuously increasing. As a result, the need for management and processing solutions has become critical. Unfortunately, while most of these data have a spatial component, almost none of the current systems are able to manage it. For example, while Spark may be the most efficient environment for managing Big data, it is only used by five spatial data management systems. None of these solutions fully complies with ISO standards and OGC specifications in terms of spatial processing, and many of them are neither efficient enough nor extensible. The authors seek a way to overcome these limitations. Therefore, after a detailed study of the limitations of the existing systems, they define a system in greater accordance with the ISO19125 standard. The proposed solution, Elcano, is an extension of Spark complying with this standard and allowing the SQL querying of spatial data. Finally, the tests demonstrate that the resulting system surpasses the current available solutions on the market.",

In addition, it is increasingly possible to track the user\u2019s location, which provides immense opportunities in geospatial data and its management. Due to the use of location information in services for each mobile device, a large size of spatial data makes it difficult to process spatial queries efficiently and, therefore, we need a lightweight and scalable approach to process large amounts of stored data in distributed file systems. For the most part, all SNSs (social network services) focus on connecting the user account with their location information, such as check-in services, which helps them collect information about user activities and ratings. Of location, but also increases the load of data on their servers. . In this article we propose an indexing technique in combination with efficient processing of Boolean top-k spatial queries where location data is compressed to save space and the Boolean query helps filter results so that unrelated data is not processed, what helps to save space and faster processing of queries.",

            "abstract": "As a result of tremendous rise in internet usage like social media and forums, mail systems, scholarly and research articles, daily online transactions from multiple sources like health care systems, meteorological and environmental organizations etc., the data collected has shoot up exponentially. This vast collection of data, called Big Data, has caused the traditional tools incompetent for managing it from either of storage, computing or analytical perspective. There is an immense need of architectures, platforms, tools, techniques and algorithms to handle Big Data. The available technologies deal with two broad aspects related to Big Data that are Big Data Storage Management and Big Data Computing, focused to overcome various challenges such as scalability, faster processing speed, multiple format data processing, availability, faster response time and analytics etc. This paper reviews recent trends of storage and computing tools with their relative capabilities, limitations and environment they are suitable to work with.",

            "abstract": "In the past years, the increase in data has been accompanied by rapid growth in various fields. It is difficult to analyze large volumes of data using traditional and relational database technology. Therefore, new databases have emerged, and for this reason, big data has become one of the new topics in IT and business today. Also, the cloud environment is increasingly used to store and process big data. Cloud processing refers to processing anything, including Big Data Analytics, on the \"cloud\". A \"cloud\" is a collection of high-powered servers from providers that can often view and query large data sets much faster than a regular computer. These two topics differ from each other in various aspects, including definition, collection references, usage method, form and format, and application. In this research, the dimensions and basic concepts, characteristics, tools and techniques, classification, and communication of data are examined. Big has been dealt with cloud computing, and in addition, storage systems, opportunities and challenges, and big data design principles in the cloud environment have been analyzed.",

Regardless of their differences, data sources must be used in tandem in any effective big data operation. This paper proposes a Software as a Service (SaaS) framework called BINARY which provides a back-end infrastructure for ad-hoc querying, accessing, visualizing and joining data from different data sources such as Relational Database Management Systems like MySQL and big data storage systems like Apache Hive. BINARY is extendable and allows adding other storage engines (e.g. HBase) and analytics engines (e.g. R) as needed. A REST software architecture is used in the framework to enable loose connections between the engines and user interface programs to facilitate their independent updates without affecting the data infrastructure. Our approach is validated with a proof-of-concept prototype implemented on the OpenStack cloud system.",

            "abstract": "The big graph database provides strong modeling capabilities and efficient querying for complex applications. Subgraph isomorphism which finds exact matches of a query graph in the database efficiently, is a challenging problem. Current subgraph isomorphism approaches mostly are based on the pruning strategy proposed by Ullmann. These techniques have two significant drawbacks- first, they are unable to efficiently handle complex queries, and second, their implementations need the large indexes that require large memory resources. In this paper, we describe a new subgraph isomorphism approach, the HyGraph algorithm, that is efficient both in querying and with memory requirements for index creation. We compare the HyGraph algorithm with two popular existing approaches, GraphQL and Cypher using complexity measures and experimentally using three big graph data sets\u2014(1) a country-level population database, (2) a simulated bank database, and (3) a publicly available World Cup big graph database. It is shown that the HyGraph solution performs significantly better (or equally) than competing algorithms for the query operations on these big databases, making it an excellent candidate for subgraph isomorphism queries in real scenarios.",

Enterprise Integration and Interoperability can ensure efficient communication among various services driven by big data. However, the data management challenges affect not only the technical implementation of software solutions but the function of the whole organization. In this paper, we bring together Enterprise Integration and Interoperability, Big Data Processing, and Industry 4.0 in order to identify synergies that have the potential to enable the so-called \u201cFourth Industrial Revolution.\u201d On this basis, we propose an architectural framework for designing and modeling Industry 4.0 solutions for big data-driven manufacturing operations. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework through its instantiation to predictive maintenance, a manufacturing function that increasingly concerns manufacturers due to the high costs, safety issues, and complexity of its application.",

            "abstract": "The rapid development of healthcare big data has brought certain convenience to medical research and health management, but privacy protection of healthcare big data is an issue that must be considered in the process of data application. Access control is one of the methods for privacy protection, but traditional access control models cannot adapt to the dynamic, continuous, and real-time characteristics of healthcare big data scenarios. In this paper, we propose an access control model based on risk quantification and usage control (RQ-UCON). The model adds a risk quantification module to the traditional UCON model to achieve privacy protection of medical data. This module classifies risks into direct and indirect risks and quantifies them based on the physician's visit history. The model stores the quantified risk values as subject attributes. The RQ-UCON model uses an improved Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) and penalty factors to predict risk value and to update the risk values of the subject attributes in real-time. The RQ-UCON model uses agglomerative hierarchical clustering to cluster the risk values of physicians within the department, resulting in risk intervals for each physician's operational behavior. Each risk interval is stored as a condition in the RQ-UCON model. Finally, according to the model whether the subject attributes meet the model conditions to determine whether the subject has the corresponding access rights, and according to the risk interval to grant the subject the corresponding access rights. Through the final experiment, it can be seen that the access control model proposed in this paper has a certain control on the excessive access behavior of doctors and has a certain limitation on the privacy leakage of healthcare big data.",

Thus we proposed a snowflake model based on HBase with a multi-table structure and three kinds of index tables for efficient assess of large-scale health records. A guideline for designing of index tables was proposed which covers the demands of most healthcare data processing applications. A benchmark test was carried out with six types of queries on a large dataset comprising 750 million records to compare the performance of the proposed model against the traditional tall-table model on HBase. We found that the snowflake model was more efficient than the tall-table model. The adoption of index tables could greatly improve the query speed and provided real-time queries for two models. In general, snowflake model could be used for managing large-scale healthcare data as an advantageous alternative.",

The availability of big data source from the Learning Management System (LMS) can be analysed to help with the attrition issues. This study aims to use an integrated Design Science Research (DSR) methodology to develop and evaluate a novel Big Data Analytical Solution (BDAS) as an educational decision support artefact. The BDAS as DSR artefact utilises Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches to predict potential students at risk. Identifying students at risk helps to take timely intervention in the learning process to improve student academic progress for increasing their retention rate. To evaluate the performance of the predictive model, we compare the accuracy of the collection of representational AI algorithms in the literature. The study utilized an integrated DSR methodology founded on the similarities of DSR and design based research (DBR) to design and develop the proposed BDAS employing an specific evaluation framework that works on real data scenarios. The BDAS does not only aimto replace any existing practice but also support educators to implement a variety of pedagogical practices for improving students\u2019 academic performance.",

However, multi-model information extraction often requires the deployment of multiple data model management, storage, and analysis subsystems on the cloud, many subsystems are not high-resource utilization at the same time, and the resource waste phenomenon is often serious. Therefore, an adaptive scalable multi-model big data analysis and information extraction system is designed and implemented in this paper, which can support data maintenance and cross-model query of relational, graph, document, key and other data models, and can provide efficient cross-model information extraction. On this basis, we can achieve the system resource allocation on demand and fast scaling mechanism, according to the real-time requirements of multi-model big data analysis, and dynamic adjustment of each subsystem resource allocation. Therefore, our solution not only guarantees multi-model query and information extraction performance and quality of service, but also significantly reduces the total consumption of system resources and cost.",

Existing trajectory data management frameworks suffer from scalability problem, and only support limited trajectory queries. This paper proposes a holistic distributed NoSQL trajectory storage engine, TrajMesa, based on GeoMesa, an open-source indexing toolkit for spatio-temporal data. TrajMesa adopts a novel storage schema, which reduces the storage size tremendously. We also devise novel indexing key designs, and propose a bunch of pruning strategies. TrajMesa can support plentiful queries efficiently, including ID-Temporal query, spatial range query, similarity query, and k-NN query. Experimental results show the powerful query efficiency and scalability of TrajMesa.",

            "abstract": "As vehicle applications, mobile devices and the Internet of Things are growing fast, and developing an efficient architecture to deal with the big data in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has been an important concern for the future smart city. To overcome the inherent defect of centralized data processing in cloud computing, fog computing has been proposed by offloading computation tasks to local fog servers (LFSs). By considering factors like latency, mobility, localization, and scalability, this article proposes a regional cooperative fog-computing-based intelligent vehicular network (CFC-IoV) architecture for dealing with big IoV data in the smart city. Possible services for IoV applications are discussed, including mobility control, multi-source data acquisition, distributed computation and storage, and multi-path data transmission. A hierarchical model with intra-fog and inter-fog resource management is presented, and energy efficiency and packet dropping rates of LFSs in CFC-IoV are optimized.",

            "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) has widespread applications and has revolutionized many industries, but suffers from several challenges. First, sufficient high-quality training data is inevitable for producing a well-performed model, but the data is always human expensive to acquire. Second, a large amount of training data and complicated model structures lead to the inefficiency of training and inference. Third, given an ML task, one always needs to train lots of models, which are hard to manage in real applications. Fortunately, database techniques can benefit ML by addressing the above three challenges. In this paper, we review existing studies from the following three aspects along with the pipeline highly related to ML. (1) Data preparation (Pre-ML): it focuses on preparing high-quality training data that can improve the performance of the ML model, where we review data discovery, data cleaning and data labeling. (2) Model training & inference (In-ML): researchers in ML community focus on improving the model performance during training, while in this survey we mainly study how to accelerate the entire training process, also including feature selection and model selection. (3) Model management (Post-ML): in this part, we survey how to store, query, deploy and debug the models after training. Finally, we provide research challenges and future directions.",

            "abstract": "The proliferation of private clouds that are often underutilized and the tremendous computational potential of these clouds when combined has recently brought forth the idea of volunteer cloud computing (VCC), a computing model where cloud owners contribute underutilized computing and/or storage resources on their clouds to support the execution of applications of other members in the community. This model is particularly suitable to solve big data scientific problems. Scientists in data-intensive scientific fields increasingly recognize that sharing volunteered resources from several clouds is a cost-effective alternative to solve many complex, data- and/or compute-intensive science problems. Despite the promise of the idea of VCC, it still remains at the vision stage at best. Challenges include the heterogeneity and autonomy of member clouds, access control and security, complex inter-cloud virtual machine scheduling, etc. In this paper, we present CloudFinder, a system that supports the efficient execution of big data workloads on volunteered federated clouds (VFCs). Our evaluation of the system indicates that VFCs are a promising cost-effective approach to enable big data science.",

With the fast development of networking, data storage, and the data collection capacity, Big Data are now rapidly expanding in all science and engineering domains, including physical, biological and biomedical sciences. This paper presents a HACE theorem that characterizes the features of the Big Data revolution, and proposes a Big Data processing model, from the data mining perspective. This data-driven model involves demand-driven aggregation of information sources, mining and analysis, user interest modeling, and security and privacy considerations. We analyze the challenging issues in the data-driven model and also in the Big Data revolution.",

            "abstract": "Apache Cassandra is a leading distributed database of choice when it comes to big data management with zero downtime, linear scalability, and seamless multiple data center deployment. With increasingly wider adoption of Cassandra for online transaction processing by hundreds of Web-scale companies, there is a growing need for a rigorous and practical data modeling approach that ensures sound and efficient schema design. This work i) proposes the first query-driven big data modeling methodology for Apache Cassandra, ii) defines important data modeling principles, mapping rules, and mapping patterns to guide logical data modeling, iii) presents visual diagrams for Cassandra logical and physical data models, and iv) demonstrates a data modeling tool that automates the entire data modeling process.",

            "abstract": "several customers access the data in a cloud environment. Security of such data for storing, processing, retrieving, and updating in the cloud environment is critical. If the data is sensitive, access level for every step takes primary responsibility of cloud provider. Currently, the communication of internet-enabled devices (IED) is processing big data and require cloud environment due to their limited storage, processing, and energy capabilities (battery). Encryption is the primary security for transmitting the data from IED's to the cloud, but there is no access control for the data stored in the cloud. Kerberos, a third party authentication protocol, builds on symmetric key (cryptography basis) to allow the nodes for non-secure information, but it does not provide the access control on stored data and other management of the data in the cloud. Because of the current status of the cloud access facilities, this paper builds an event-based access control model for the variety of users and the analysis of messages from social media data, text data, and continuously generated data. In trials, the event-based model was applied to identify the spikes in data (messages or stored data) and decisions based on spikes in the data in a window of time.",

These processes\u2019 effectiveness depends on the data's quality and their structured or unstructured nature. We are witnessing a growing number of applications based on unstructured data mining in the accounting and management fields. This research aims to demonstrating that despite the traditional association between accounting and quantitative analyses (expected to be based mainly on structured financial data). The findings show that several useful applications now rely on unstructured data in this field. A basic analysis of the cybersecurity risks is also presented, along with mitigating strategies to allow companies to comply with current regulations such as the GDPR. The result might appear surprising from the business perspective, but it is not from a data science perspective. In conclusion the growing number of unsctructured data business applications should orientate a better understanding of their potential and target better training of finance specialist on data processing skills.",

            "abstract": "When addressing the problem of \u201cbig\u201d data volume, preparation costs are one of the key challenges: the high costs for loading, aggregating and indexing data leads to a long data-to-insight time. In addition to being a nuisance to the end-user, this latency prevents real-time analytics on \u201cbig\u201d data. Fortunately, data often comes in semantic chunks such as files that contain data items that share some characteristics such as acquisition time or location. A data management system that exploits this trait can significantly lower the data preparation costs and the associated data-to-insight time by only investing in the preparation of the relevant chunks. In this paper, we develop such a system as an extension of an existing relational DBMS (MonetDB). To this end, we develop a query processing paradigm and data storage model that are partial-loading aware. The result is a system that can make a 1.2 TB dataset (consisting of 4000 chunks) ready for querying in less than 3 minutes on a single server-class machine while maintaining good query processing performance.",

The convergence and the impact of emotion are getting faster and faster. Timely and effective understanding and grasping the changes and development of employees\u2019 public opinion has become an important topic. The development of big data technology makes it possible and necessary to construct an employees\u2019 public opinion system. Based on big data and theories of public opinion generation and dissemination, this paper built a big data-based employees\u2019 public opinion system and its main functions, including big data collection, data processing, data storage, data analysis, data visualization, and early warning of employees\u2019 public opinion. Finally, we also defined the rich connotation of employees\u2019 public opinion index.",

However, these systems are either pure storage systems with online data query service, or just offline batch processing systems with data analytics functionality. Heavy data movement (e.g., data loading) occurs in order to analyze the data. In this paper, we propose an innovative in-memory data management system\u2014MemepiC, which unifies both online data query and data analytics functionality, allowing low-latency storage service and efficient in-situ data analytics. We also explore the emerging RDMA technique in the context of in-memory data management systems, by designing an RDMA-based communication protocol for message delivery inside MemepiC, and proposing to overlap execution and RDMA communication. Extensive experiments are conducted to show the superior performance of MemepiC in terms of both the storage and the data analytics services, compared against other in-memory systems.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Spatial vector data with high-precision and wide-coverage has exploded globally, such as land cover, social media, and other data-sets, which provides a good opportunity to enhance the national macroscopic decision-making, social supervision, public services, and emergency capabilities. Simultaneously, it also brings great challenges in management technology for big spatial vector data (BSVD). In recent years, a large number of new concepts, parallel algorithms, processing tools, platforms, and applications have been proposed and developed to improve the value of BSVD from both academia and industry. To better understand BSVD and take advantage of its value effectively, this paper presents a review that surveys recent studies and research work in the data management field for BSVD. In this paper, we discuss and itemize this topic from three aspects according to different information technical levels of big spatial vector data management. It aims to help interested readers to learn about the latest research advances and choose the most suitable big data technologies and approaches depending on their system architectures. To support them more fully, firstly, we identify new concepts and ideas from numerous scholars about geographic information system to focus on BSVD scope in the big data era. Then, we conclude systematically not only the most recent published literatures but also a global view of main spatial technologies of BSVD, including data storage and organization, spatial index, processing methods, and spatial analysis. Finally, based on the above commentary and related work, several opportunities and challenges are listed as the future research interests and directions for reference.",

            "abstract": "Modern geoinformation technologies for collecting and processing data, such as laser scanning or photogrammetry, can generate point clouds with billions of points. They provide abundant information that can be used for different types of analysis. Due to its characteristics, the point cloud is often viewed as a special type of geospatial data. In order to efficiently manage such volumes of data, techniques based on a computer cluster have to be used. The Apache Spark framework has proven to be a solution for efficient processing of large volumes of data. This paper thoroughly examines the representation of point cloud data type using Apache Spark constructs. The common operations over point clouds, range queries and k-nearest neighbors queries (kNN) are implemented using Apache Spark DataFrame Application Programming Interface (API). It enabled the design of point cloud related user defined types (UDT) and user defined functions (UDF). The structure of the point cloud for efficient storing in Big Data key-value stores was analyzed and described. The methods presented in this paper were compared to PostgreSQL RDBMS, and the results were discussed.",

            "abstract": "The design and implementation of Big Data management and analysis solutions has received many benefits and improvements via the utilization of high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Today, complex processing and analysis of real-world massive data sources in AI, machine learning, and large simulations require using HPC infrastructures such as highly parallel clusters, supercomputers, and clouds (Talia, 2019). However, as parallel research and technologies advance, in the next few years, exascale computing systems will be used for implementing scalable Big Data analysis solutions in science and business (Reed and Dongarra, 2015). To reach this goal, new design and implementation challenges must be addressed and solved for exploiting the computation power of new HPC systems in running Big Data and machine learning applications. Exascale supercomputers refer to computing systems capable of at least one exaflop or a quintillion calculations per second (1018). Despite their future contribution to support very large and very complex applications, exascale systems are becoming harder and harder to use efficiently (Talia et al., 2020). In particular, in the area of Big Data analysis new solutions are needed to achieve scalable software systems running quickly on exascale platforms. Extreme data refers to massive amounts of Big Data that must be queried, communicated, and analyzed in (near) real-time by using a very large number of memory and computing elements. Large repositories and continuous streams of data soon will be processed and analyzed by Exascale computing systems that today are under development (Gropp and Snir, 2013). Significant examples are scientific data produced at a rate of hundreds of gigabits-per-second that must be stored, filtered, and analyzed; millions of images per day that must be analyzed in parallel; or billions of social data posts queried in realtime on an in-memory components database. Nowadays, traditional disks and commercial storage systems cannot handle the extreme scale of data required for such applications and a very large number of cores are needed to process them. Following the need for improvement of current concepts and technologies, this Research Topic aims at focusing on data-intensive algorithms, systems, and applications running on systems composed of up to millions of computing elements on which are based the exascale systems.

As a result, a variety of schemes for big trajectory data management have been proposed. However, the factor of data transmission is not considered in most of these, resulting in a certain impact on query efficiency. In view of that, we present THBase, a coprocessor-based scheme for big trajectory data management in HBase. THBase introduces a segment-based data model and a moving-object-based partition model to solve massive trajectory data storage, and exploits a hybrid local secondary index structure based on Observer coprocessor to accelerate spatiotemporal queries. Furthermore, it adopts certain maintenance strategies to ensure the colocation of relevant data. Based on these, THBase designs node-locality-based parallel query algorithms by Endpoint coprocessor to reduce the overhead caused by data transmission, thus ensuring efficient query performance. Experiments on datasets of ship trajectory show that our schemes can significantly outperform other schemes.",

            "abstract": "Influenced by the innovative technological advances made in recent years, a number of major economies are increasing their national investment in building decision support systems applicable to the industrial sector. This study was conducted with government support to analyze big data in engineering accumulated from the past, develop tools for forecasting and risk management, and use them to build systems that support decision-making. The target of system development for this study is the industrial engineering sector, also known as Engineering- Procurement-Construction (EPC), and is largely divided into five modules, as follows. First, engineering design cost prediction targeted accurately predicting Man-Hour (M/H) and provided useful references to contractors and project managers by developing models that predict design costs in the engineering field. Using the M/H prediction model developed by this research, M/H under similar environments or conditions can be predicted and solutions prepared on the project start stage to manage potential risks. Second, engineering design error analysis was conducted with the purpose of helping project implementation risk management by developing a system to analyze actual design error data that occurred in past projects in order to minimize and prevent design errors. Third, engineering design change analysis was conducted to analyze amounts that could be added by changing order and preparing countermeasures in advance due to design changes occurring during the project. The system was built to support decision-making as a result of utilizing accumulated data. Fourth, engineering Invitation to Bid (ITB) analysis established a support system to efficiently perform ITB analysis and carry out new processes that automatically detect and present provisions that could pose risks. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques were applied to conduct the analysis, and Subject-Matter Experts (SMEs) verified the quality during the process of establishing the procedure. Fifth, equipment maintenance cycle forecasting was conducted to predict the demand for repairing items and ensure that equipment requiring maintenance could be prepared before the predicted malfunction. This paper first introduces the five modules of decision support systems in a wide range, then details the results of the fourth module, the Engineering ITB Analysis step by step.",

            "abstract": "With the increase in the amount of data captured during the manufacturing process, monitoring systems are becoming important factors in decision making for management. Current technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT)-based sensors can be considered a solution to provide efficient monitoring of the manufacturing process. In this study, a real-time monitoring system that utilizes IoT-based sensors, big data processing, and a hybrid prediction model is proposed. Firstly, an IoT-based sensor that collects temperature, humidity, accelerometer, and gyroscope data was developed. The characteristics of IoT-generated sensor data from the manufacturing process are: real-time, large amounts, and unstructured type. The proposed big data processing platform utilizes Apache Kafka as a message queue, Apache Storm as a real-time processing engine and MongoDB to store the sensor data from the manufacturing process. Secondly, for the proposed hybrid prediction model, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)-based outlier detection and Random Forest classification were used to remove outlier sensor data and provide fault detection during the manufacturing process, respectively. The proposed model was evaluated and tested at an automotive manufacturing assembly line in Korea. The results showed that IoT-based sensors and the proposed big data processing system are sufficiently efficient to monitor the manufacturing process. Furthermore, the proposed hybrid prediction model has better fault prediction accuracy than other models given the sensor data as input. The proposed system is expected to support management by improving decision-making and will help prevent unexpected losses caused by faults during the manufacturing process.",

However MapReduce has two function Map and Reduce, large data is stored through HDFS. Lack of facility involve in MapReduce so Spark is designed to run for real time stream data and for fast queries. Spark jobs perform work on Resilient Distributed Datasets and directed acyclic graph execution engine. In this paper, we extend Hadoop MapReduce working and Spark architecture with supporting kind of operation to perform. We also show the differences between Hadoop MapReduce and Spark through Map and Reduce phase individually.",

            "abstract": "Exploiting available condition monitoring data of industrial machines for intelligent maintenance purposes has been attracting attention in various application fields. Machine learning algorithms for fault detection, diagnosis and prognosis are popular and easily accessible. However, our experience in working at the intersection of academia and industry showed that the major challenges of building an end-to-end system in a real-world industrial setting go beyond the design of machine learning algorithms. One of the major challenges is the design of an end-to-end data management solution that is able to efficiently store and process large amounts of heterogeneous data streams resulting from a variety of physical machines. In this paper we present the design of an end-to-end Big Data architecture that enables intelligent maintenance in a real-world industrial setting. In particular, we will discuss various physical design choices for optimizing high-dimensional queries, such as partitioning and Z-ordering, that serve as the basis for health analytics. Finally, we describe a concrete fault detection use case with two different health monitoring algorithms based on machine learning and classical statistics and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. The paper covers some of the most important aspects of the practical implementation of such an end-to-end solution and demonstrates the challenges and their mitigation for the specific application of laser cutting machines.",
