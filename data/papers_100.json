            "abstract": "\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this work is to survey the body of research revolving around big data (BD) and analytics in hospitality and tourism, by detecting macro topical areas, research streams and gaps and to develop an agenda for future research.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis research is based on a systematic literature review of academic papers indexed in the Scopus and Web of Science databases published up to 31 December 2020. The outputs were analyzed using bibliometric techniques, network analysis and topic modeling.\n\n\nFindings\nThe number of scientific outputs in research with hospitality and tourism settings has been expanding over the period 2015\u20132020, with a substantial stability of the areas examined. The vast majority are published in academic journals where the main reference area is neither hospitality nor tourism. The body of research is rather fragmented and studies on relevant aspects, such as BD analytics capabilities, are virtually missing. Most of the outputs are empirical. Moreover, many of the articles collected relatively small quantities of records and, regardless of the time period considered, only a handful of articles mix a number of different techniques.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis work sheds new light on the emergence of a body of research at the intersection of hospitality and tourism management and data science. It enriches and complements extant literature reviews on BD and analytics, combining these two interconnected topics.\n",

            "abstract": "In recent times, big data has become a popular research topic and brought about a range of new challenges that must be tackled to support many commercial and research demands. The transport arena is one example that has much to benefit from big data capabilities in allowing to process voluminous amounts of data that is created in real time and in vast quantities. Tackling these big data issues requires capabilities not typically found in common Cloud platforms. This includes a distributed file system for capturing and storing data, a high performance computing engine able to process such large quantities of data, a reliable database system able to optimize the indexing and querying of the data, and geospatial capabilities to visualize the resultant analyzed data. In this paper we present SMASH, a generic and highly scalable Cloud-based architecture and its implementation that meets these many demands. We focus here specifically on the utilization of the SMASH software stack to process large scale traffic data for Adelaide and Victoria although we note that the solution can be applied to other big data processing areas. We provide performance results on SMASH and compare it with other big data solutions that have been developed.",

            "abstract": "Query processing over big data is ubiquitous in modern clouds, where the system takes care of picking both the physical query execution plans and the resources needed to run those plans, using a cost-based query optimizer. A good cost model, therefore, is akin to better resource efficiency and lower operational costs. Unfortunately, the production workloads at Microsoft show that costs are very complex to model for big data systems. In this work, we investigate two key questions: (i) can we learn accurate cost models for big data systems, and (ii) can we integrate the learned models within the query optimizer. To answer these, we make three core contributions. First, we exploit workload patterns to learn a large number of individual cost models and combine them to achieve high accuracy and coverage over a long period. Second, we propose extensions to Cascades framework to pick optimal resources, i.e, number of containers, during query planning. And third, we integrate the learned cost models within the Cascade-style query optimizer of SCOPE at Microsoft. We evaluate the resulting system, Cleo, in a production environment using both production and TPC-H workloads. Our results show that the learned cost models are 2 to 3 orders of magnitude more accurate, and 20X more correlated with the actual runtimes, with a large majority (70%) of the plan changes leading to substantial improvements in latency as well as resource usage.",

The rise in amount of Linked data and Knowledge graphs has resulted in an increase in the volume of RDF data. RDF is used to model metadata especially for social media domains where the data is linked. With the plethora of RDF data sources available on the Web, scalable RDF data management becomes a tedious task. In this paper, we present MuSe\u2014an efficient distributed RDF storage scheme for storing and querying RDF data with Hadoop MapReduce. In MuSe, the Big RDF data is stored at two levels for answering the common triple patterns in SPARQL queries. MuSe considers the type of frequently occuring triple patterns and optimizes RDF storage to answer such triple patterns in minimum time. It accesses only the tables that are sufficient for answering a triple pattern instead of scanning the whole RDF dataset. The extensive experiments on two synthetic RDF datasets i.e. LUBM and WatDiv, show that MuSe outperforms the compared state-of-the art frameworks in terms of query execution time and scalability.",

            "abstract": "Spatial modeling is an integral component of most geographic information systems (GISs). However, conventional GIS modeling techniques can require substantial processing time and storage space and have limited statistical and machine learning functionality. To address these limitations, many have parallelized spatial models using multiple coding libraries and have applied those models in a multiprocessor environment. Few, however, have recognized the inefficiencies associated with the underlying spatial modeling framework used to implement such analyses. In this paper, we identify a common inefficiency in processing spatial models and demonstrate a novel approach to address it using lazy evaluation techniques. Furthermore, we introduce a new coding library that integrates Accord.NET and ALGLIB numeric libraries and uses lazy evaluation to facilitate a wide range of spatial, statistical, and machine learning procedures within a new GIS modeling framework called function modeling. Results from simulations show a 64.3% reduction in processing time and an 84.4% reduction in storage space attributable to function modeling. In an applied case study, this translated to a reduction in processing time from 2247 h to 488 h and a reduction is storage space from 152 terabytes to 913 gigabytes.",

            "abstract": "- Data is exploding at a rapid rate. Big data is the term for data sets so large and complicated that it becomes difficult to process using traditional data management tools or processing applications. Heterogeneity, scale, timeliness, complexity, and privacy problems with Big Data impede progress at all phases of the pipeline that can create value from data. The problems start right away during data acquisition, when the data tsunami requires us to make decisions, currently in an ad hoc manner, about what data to keep and what to discard, and how to store what we keep reliably with the right metadata. Much data today is not natively in structured format, tweets and blogs are weakly structured pieces of text, while images and video are structured for storage and display, but not for semantic content and search. Transforming such content into a structured format for later analysis is a major challenge. The value of data explodes when it can be linked with other data, thus data integration is a major creator of value. Since most data is directly generated in digital format today, we have the opportunity and the challenge both to influence the creation to facilitate later linkage and to automatically link previously created data. Data analysis, organization, retrieval, and modeling are other foundational challenges. Data analysis is a clear bottleneck in many applications, both due to lack of scalability of the underlying algorithms and due to the complexity of the data that needs to be analyzed. Finally, presentation of the results and its interpretation by non-technical domain experts is crucial to extracting actionable knowledge.",

            "abstract": "Identity-based remote data auditing schemes can verify data integrity and provide a simple identity authentication and management for multiple users. However, prior works on identity-based remote data auditing lack the support of dynamic operations. In these schemes, tag generation is linked to the index of data block, which is related to update operations such as modification, insertion and deletion. If users perform dynamic operations on a data block, the tags of all subsequent blocks need to be modified. It means that if users want to update data on a big data platform, they have to download the whole file, update the file and send the updated file to the big data platform. Such pattern will bring huge communication overhead. In this paper, we propose an identity-based dynamic data auditing scheme which supports dynamic data operations, including modification, insertion and deletion. As far as we know, there is still no other identity-based data auditing scheme that supports dynamic operations. In particular, to achieve efficient dynamic operations, we use the data structure of Merkle hash tree for block tag authentication, which helps update data with integrity assurance. Analyses of security and performance show that the proposed scheme is efficient and secure.",

The main objective was to design a scalable analytical platform that will support the collection, storage and processing of data from multiple industry domains. Such a platform should be able to connect to the existing environment in the plant and use the data gathered to build predictive functions to optimize the production processes. The analytical platform will contain a development environment with which to build these functions, and a simulation environment to evaluate the models. The platform will be shared among multiple sites from different industry sectors. Cross-sectorial sharing will enable the transfer of knowledge across different domains. During the development, we adopted a user-centered approach to gather requirements from different stakeholders which were used to design architectural models from different viewpoints, from contextual to deployment. The deployed architecture was tested in two process industry domains, one from the aluminium production and the other from the plastic molding industry.",

            "abstract": "While recent debate recognizes the importance of big data (BD) and knowledge management (KM) in firm performance, there has been a paucity of literature regarding big data analytics technological (BDAT) and knowledge exploration-exploitation capabilities (KEEC) in the context of business process innovation (BPI). This study aims to identify whether BD and KM can be established in these emerging issues. We used a survey questionnaire to collect data from various firms and industries. We used structural equation modeling (SmartPLS and SPSS) to validate the research model with a sample of 155 companies in a developing country such as Indonesia. The result demonstrates a positive relationship between KEEC and BPI, followed by several significant findings such as BDAT with KEEC; KEEC on big data knowledge management (BDKM); BDKM and BPI; and BDAT on BDKM. In contrast, BDAT is nonsignificant for direct relationship on BPI, and interestingly, it becomes a significant result after mediated by BDKM. Similarly, BDKM has successfully mediated the relationship between KEEC and BPI. The management level ideally develops and increases such a knowledge creation/acquisition practices and BDAT in an organization to gain more meaningful benefits from these two capabilities. BDAT, KEEC, and BDKM simultaneously are a clear antecedent approach, which ultimately results in flexibility, effectiveness, and effectivity of BPI. The cases of this research are profit firms in a developing country such as Indonesia. A future study could be considered in different settings such as type of industries or more specific company's type, the economy level of countries (comparing between developed and developing countries), and environmental dynamical. A novel field of study is the inclusion of knowledge exploration-exploitation and BDAT that drives BPI.",

            "abstract": "Big data storage technologies inherently entail high latency characteristics, preventing users from performing efficient ad-hoc querying and interactive visualization on large and distributed datasets. Most of the existing approaches addressing this issue thrive on de-normalization of the static data schema and creation of application specific (i.e. hard-coded) materialized views, which certainly reduce data access latency but at the expense of flexibility. In this regard, this paper proposes an approach that relies on an iterative process of data transformation intended to generate read-optimized data schemas. The transformation process is able to automatically identify optimization opportunities (e.g. materialized views, missing indexes), by analyzing the original data schema and the record of queries issued by users and client applications against the data set. An experimental evaluation of the proposed approach evidences a significant reduction in the query latency, ranging from 81.60% to 99.99%.",

            "abstract": "There is a great thrust in industry toward the development of more feasible and viable tools for storing fast-growing volume, velocity, and diversity of data, termed \u2018big data\u2019. The structural shift of the storage mechanism from traditional data management systems to NoSQL technology is due to the intention of fulfilling big data storage requirements. However, the available big data storage technologies are inefficient to provide consistent, scalable, and available solutions for continuously growing heterogeneous data. Storage is the preliminary process of big data analytics for real-world applications such as scientific experiments, healthcare, social networks, and e-business. So far, Amazon, Google, and Apache are some of the industry standards in providing big data storage solutions, yet the literature does not report an in-depth survey of storage technologies available for big data, investigating the performance and magnitude gains of these technologies. The primary objective of this paper is to conduct a comprehensive investigation of state-of-the-art storage technologies available for big data. A well-defined taxonomy of big data storage technologies is presented to assist data analysts and researchers in understanding and selecting a storage mechanism that better fits their needs. To evaluate the performance of different storage architectures, we compare and analyze the existing approaches using Brewer\u2019s CAP theorem. The significance and applications of storage technologies and support to other categories are discussed. Several future research challenges are highlighted with the intention to expedite the deployment of a reliable and scalable storage system.",

            "abstract": "The term data quality refers to measuring the fitness of data regarding the intended usage. Poor data quality leads to inadequate, inconsistent, and erroneous decisions that could escalate the computational cost, cause a decline in profits, and cause customer churn. Thus, data quality is crucial for researchers and industry practitioners. Different factors drive the assessment of data quality. Data context is deemed one of the key factors due to the contextual diversity of real-world use cases of various entities such as people and organizations. Data used in a specific context (e.g., an organization policy) may need to be more efficacious for another context. Hence, implementing a data quality assessment solution in different contexts is challenging. Traditional technologies for data quality assessment reached the pinnacle of maturity. Existing solutions can solve most of the quality issues. The data context in these solutions is defined as validation rules applied within the ETL (extract, transform, load) process, i.e., the data warehousing process. In contrast to traditional data quality management, it is impossible to specify all the data semantics beforehand for big data. We need context-aware data quality rules to detect semantic errors in a massive amount of heterogeneous data generated at high speed. While many researchers tackle the quality issues of big data, they define the data context from a specific standpoint. Although data quality is a longstanding research issue in academia and industries, it remains an open issue, especially with the advent of big data, which has fostered the challenge of data quality assessment more than ever. This article provides a scoping review to study the existing context-aware data quality assessment solutions, starting with the existing big data quality solutions in general and then covering context-aware solutions. The strength and weaknesses of such solutions are outlined and discussed. The survey showed that none of the existing data quality assessment solutions could guarantee context awareness with the ability to handle big data. Notably, each solution dealt only with a partial view of the context. We compared the existing quality models and solutions to reach a comprehensive view covering the aspects of context awareness when assessing data quality. This led us to a set of recommendations framed in a methodological framework shaping the design and implementation of any context-aware data quality service for big data. Open challenges are then identified and discussed.",

To achieve high performance, LocationSpark employs various spatial indexes for in-memory data, and guarantees that immutable spatial indexes have low overhead with fault tolerance. In addition, we build two new layers over Spark, namely a query scheduler and a query executor. The query scheduler is responsible for mitigating skew in spatial queries, while the query executor selects the best plan based on the indexes and the nature of the spatial queries. Furthermore, to avoid unnecessary network communication overhead when processing overlapped spatial data, We embed an efficient spatial Bloom filter into LocationSpark's indexes. Finally, LocationSpark tracks frequently accessed spatial data, and dynamically flushes less frequently accessed data into disk. We evaluate our system on real workloads and demonstrate that it achieves an order of magnitude performance gain over a baseline framework.",

            "abstract": "For over many decades, relational database model has been considered as the leading model for data storage and management. However, as the Big Data explosion has generated a large volume of data, alternative models like NoSQL and NewSQL have emerged. With the advancement of communication technology, these database systems have given the potential to change the existing architecture from centralized mechanism to distributed in nature, to deploy as cloud-based solutions. Though all of these evolving technologies mostly focus on performance guarantees, it is still being a major concern how these systems can ensure the security and privacy of the information they handle. Different datastores support different types of integrated security mechanisms, however, most of the non-relational database systems have overlooked the security requirements of modern Big Data applications. This paper reviews security implementations in today's leading database models giving more emphasis on security and privacy attributes. A set of standard security mechanisms have been identified and evaluated based on different security classifications. Further, it provides a thorough review and a comprehensive analysis on maturity of security and privacy implementations in these database models along with future directions/enhancements so that data owners can decide on most appropriate datastore for their data-driven Big Data applications.",

This data has many characteristics and consists of structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data formats. It contains valuable information for the different types of stakeholders based on their need however it is not possible to meet them with the help of traditional tools and techniques. Here the big data technologies play a crucial role to handle, store, and process this tremendous amount of data in real-time. Big data analytics is used to extract meaningful information or patterns from the voluminous data. It can be further divided into three types i.e. text analytics, audio analytics, video analytics, and social media analytics. Big data analytics if followed by big data analysis process plays a significant role in generating meaningful information from big data. Big data analysis process consists of data acquisition, data storage, data management, data analytics, and finally data visualization. However, it is not simple and brings many challenges that need to be resolved. This paper presents the issues and challenges related to big data, prominent characteristics of big data, big data analytics, big data analysis process, and technologies used for processing the massive data.",

The data in a structured and unstructured format require a specific approach for overall handling. The classifiers analyzed in this paper are correlative na\u00efve Bayes classifier (CNB), Cuckoo Grey wolf CNB (CGCNB), Fuzzy CNB (FCNB), and Holoentropy CNB (HCNB). These classifiers are based on the Bayesian principle and work accordingly. The CNB is developed by extending the standard na\u00efve Bayes classifier with applied correlation among the attributes to become a dependent hypothesis. The cuckoo search and grey wolf optimization algorithms are integrated with the CNB classifier, and significant performance improvement is achieved. The resulting classifier is called a cuckoo grey wolf correlative na\u00efve Bayes classifier (CGCNB). Also, the performance of the FCNB and HCNB classifiers are analyzed with CNB and CGCNB by considering accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, memory, and execution time.",

            "abstract": "With the advancement of information and communication technology, data are being generated at an exponential rate via various instruments and collected at an unprecedented scale. Such large volume of data generated is referred to as big data, which now are revolutionizing all aspects of our life ranging from enterprises to individuals, from science communities to governments, as they exhibit great potentials to improve efficiency of enterprises and the quality of life. To obtain nontrivial patterns and derive valuable information from big data, a fundamental problem is how to properly place the collected data by different users to distributed clouds and to efficiently analyze the collected data to save user costs in data storage and processing, particularly the cost savings of users who share data. By doing so, it needs the close collaborations among the users, by sharing and utilizing the big data in distributed clouds due to the complexity and volume of big data. Since computing, storage and bandwidth resources in a distributed cloud usually are limited, and such resource provisioning typically is expensive, the collaborative users require to make use of the resources fairly. In this paper, we study a novel collaboration- and fairness-aware big data management problem in distributed cloud environments that aims to maximize the system throughout, while minimizing the operational cost of service providers to achieve the system throughput, subject to resource capacity and user fairness constraints. We first propose a novel optimization framework for the problem. We then devise a fast yet scalable approximation algorithm based on the built optimization framework. We also analyze the time complexity and approximation ratio of the proposed algorithm. We finally conduct experiments by simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is promising, and outperforms other heuristics.",

A vast amount of research work has been done in the multimedia area, targeting different aspects of big data analytics, such as the capture, storage, indexing, mining, and retrieval of multimedia big data. However, very few research work provides a complete survey of the whole pine-line of the multimedia big data analytics, including the management and analysis of the large amount of data, the challenges and opportunities, and the promising research directions. To serve this purpose, we present this survey, which conducts a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art research work on multimedia big data analytics. It also aims to bridge the gap between multimedia challenges and big data solutions by providing the current big data frameworks, their applications in multimedia analyses, the strengths and limitations of the existing methods, and the potential future directions in multimedia big data analytics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey that targets the most recent multimedia management techniques for very large-scale data and also provides the research studies and technologies advancing the multimedia analyses in this big data era.",

            "abstract": "Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are characterized by the deep complex intertwining among cyber components and physical components. Due to the fast increase in system complexities, the operations of CPS involve sensing, processing and storage of massive amount of data. This nature of \u201cbig data\u201d imposes fundamental challenges on the design and management of CPS in multiple aspects such as performance, energy efficiency, security, privacy, reliability, sustainability, fault tolerance, scalability and flexibility.

            "abstract": "In the multi-core era, much software has been developed using parallel programming technology, such as OpenMP, to take full advantage of the CPU cores. Nevertheless, in the era of big data, ubiquitous systems have enabled data collection on an unprecedented scale, the existing computing power and storage capacity can no longer effectively satisfy the needs of big data processing. MapReduce is a parallel programming model in cloud computing, which provides a new way to cope with the problem of OpenMP program's resource limitations for processing big data. In order to enable the legacy OpenMP-based program to take advantage of the virtue of cloud computing for processing big data, it is worth studying how to refactor it into MapReduce model. A detailed approach for refactoring OpenMP to MapReduce is proposed, and a prototype tool O2MR was developed in this paper. Two experiments show that the refactoring approach is efficient and the tool is helpful to refactoring process. In addition, the program execution times before and after refactoring were compared by five data sets, and the results demonstrate that the refactored program has better performance than the original in the face of big data, and the performance of the refactored program will be better as the amount of data increases.",

            "abstract": "Recent advances in sensor-equipped smartphones are opening brand new opportunities, such as automatically extracting Points Of Interest (POIs) and mobility habits of citizens in Smart Cities from the large amount of harvested data hotspots. At the same time, the high dynamicity and unpredictability of Smart Cities crowds, opportunistically collaborating toward these common crowdsensing tasks, introduces challenging issues due to the need for fast and continuous processing of these Big Data Streams in the backend of next generation crowdsensing platforms. This paper presents our practical experiences and lessons learnt in deploying the ParticipAct platform and living lab, an ongoing experiment at University of Bologna that involves 300 students for one year. Among all management issues addressed in ParticipAct, this article shows the integration of MongoDB in the ParticipAct backend, as a powerful NoSQL storage and processing engine to fasten the identification of POIs; the reported performance results confirm the feasibility of the approach by quantifying its advantages for city managers.",

            "abstract": "With the increasing popularity of cloud-based data services, data owners are highly motivated to store their huge amount of potentially sensitive personal data files on remote servers in encrypted form. Clients later can query over the encrypted database to retrieve files while protecting privacy of both the queries and the database, by allowing some reasonable leakage information. To this end, the notion of searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) was proposed. Meanwhile, recent literature has shown that most dynamic SSE solutions leaking information on updated keywords are vulnerable to devastating file-injection attacks. The only way to thwart these attacks is to design forward-private schemes. In this paper, we investigate new privacy-preserving indexing and query processing protocols which meet a number of desirable properties, including the multi-keyword query processing with conjunction and disjunction logic queries, practically high privacy guarantees with adaptive chosen keyword attack (CKA2) security and forward privacy, the support of dynamic data operations, and so on. Compared with previous schemes, our solutions are highly compact, practical, and flexible. Their performance and security are carefully characterized by rigorous analysis. Experimental evaluations conducted over a large representative data set demonstrate that our solutions can achieve modest search time efficiency, and they are practical for use in large-scale encrypted database systems.",

            "abstract": "Big data have become an integral part of various research fields due to the rapid advancements in the digital technologies available for dealing with data. The construction industry is no exception and has seen a spike in the data being generated due to the introduction of various digital disruptive technologies. However, despite the availability of data and the introduction of such technologies, the construction industry is lagging in harnessing big data. This paper critically explores literature published since 2010 to identify the data trends and how the construction industry can benefit from big data. The presence of tools such as computer-aided drawing (CAD) and building information modelling (BIM) provide a great opportunity for researchers in the construction industry to further improve how infrastructure can be developed, monitored, or improved in the future. The gaps in the existing research data have been explored and a detailed analysis was carried out to identify the different ways in which big data analysis and storage work in relevance to the construction industry. Big data engineering (BDE) and statistics are among the most crucial steps for integrating big data technology in construction. The results of this study suggest that while the existing research studies have set the stage for improving big data research, the integration of the associated digital technologies into the construction industry is not very clear. Among the future opportunities, big data research into construction safety, site management, heritage conservation, and project waste minimization and quality improvements are key areas.",

            "abstract": "Push-based database management system (DBMS) is a new type of data processing software that streams large volume of data to concurrent query operators. The high data rate of such systems requires large computing power provided by the query engine. In our previous work, we built a push-based DBMS named G-SDMS to harness the unrivaled computational capabilities of modern GPUs. A major design goal of G-SDMS is to support concurrent processing of heterogenous query processing operations and enable resource allocation among such operations. Understanding the performance of operations as a result of resource consumption is thus a premise in the design of G-SDMS. With NVIDIA's CUDA framework as the system implementation platform, we present our recent work on performance modeling of CUDA kernels running concurrently under a runtime mechanism named CUDA stream. Specifically, we explore the connection between performance and resource occupancy of compute-bound kernels and develop a model that can predict the performance of such kernels. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth anatomy of the CUDA stream mechanism and summarize the main kernel scheduling disciplines in it. Our models and derived scheduling disciplines are verified by extensive experiments using synthetic and real-world CUDA kernels.",

            "abstract": "Low-rank modeling plays a pivotal role in signal processing and machine learning, with applications ranging from collaborative filtering, video surveillance, and medical imaging to dimensionality reduction and adaptive filtering. Many modern high-dimensional data and interactions thereof can be modeled as lying approximately in a low-dimensional subspace or manifold, possibly with additional structures, and its proper exploitations lead to significant cost reduction in sensing, computation, and storage. In recent years, there has been a plethora of progress in understanding how to exploit low-rank structures using computationally efficient procedures in a provable manner, including both convex and nonconvex approaches. On one side, convex relaxations such as nuclear norm minimization often lead to statistically optimal procedures for estimating low-rank matrices, where first-order methods are developed to address the computational challenges; on the other side, there is emerging evidence that properly designed nonconvex procedures, such as projected gradient descent, often provide globally optimal solutions with a much lower computational cost in many problems. This survey article provides a unified overview of these recent advances in low-rank matrix estimation from incomplete measurements. Attention is paid to rigorous characterization of the performance of these algorithms and to problems where the lowrank matrix has additional structural properties that require new algorithmic designs and theoretical analysis.",

            "abstract": "Given the large and growing volume of big data and frequent use of complex analytical queries, understanding energy efficiency of query processing has become a critical research issue, as highlighted by database systems papers in the last few years. Common software solutions mainly consider IO cost models to estimate energy consumption when executing queries. On the other hand, current hardware solutions benefit from advances in the development of green components and their associated tuning techniques, especially dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), which can balance the performance and power consumption of multicore CPUs. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, there is an absence of solutions mixing both (hardware and software). Heeding this gap, we propose a novel predictive model to measure and predict energy consumption of analytical queries when using multi-core processors and different frequency configurations. We first experimentally illustrate the surprising impact of CPU frequency and the number of processor cores on execution time, power and energy consumption. Second, we introduce an extended predictive model that enriches a well-known machine learning cost model with our new angle, the frequency scaling in multi-core environment. Specifically, by using Support Vector Regression and Random Forest Regression, we compute the energy coefficients of an accurate regression model for energy prediction. Experiments with benchmark data sets TPC-H and TPC-DS evaluate our proposed framework in terms of energy consumption reduction, showing promising results.",

            "abstract": "The unprecedented proliferation of miniaturized sensors and intelligent communication, computing, and control technologies have paved the way for the development of the Industrial Internet of Things. The IIoT incorporates machine learning and massively parallel distributed systems such as clouds, clusters, and grids for big data storage, processing, and analytics. In IIoT, end devices continuously generate and transmit data streams, resulting in increased network traffic between device-cloud communication. Moreover, it increases in-network data transmissions. requiring additional efforts for big data processing, management, and analytics. To cope with these engendered issues, this article first introduces a novel concentric computing model (CCM) paradigm composed of sensing systems, outer and inner gateway processors, and central processors (outer and inner) for the deployment of big data analytics applications in IIoT. Second, we investigate, highlight, and report recent research efforts directed at the IIoT paradigm with respect to big data analytics. Third, we identify and discuss indispensable challenges that remain to be addressed for employing CCM in the IIoT paradigm. Lastly, we provide several future research directions (e.g., real-time data analytics, data integration, transmission of meaningful data, edge analytics, real-time fusion of streaming data, and security and privacy).",

            "abstract": "With an exponential increase in smart device users, there is an increase in the bulk amount of data generation from various smart devices, which varies with respect to all the essential V's used to categorize it as big data. Generally, most service providers, including Google, Amazon, Microsoft and so on, have deployed a large number of geographically distributed data centers to process this huge amount of data generated from various smart devices so that users can get quick response time. For this purpose, Hadoop, and SPARK are widely used by these service providers for processing large datasets. However, less emphasis has been given on the underlying infrastructure (the network through which data flows), which is one of the most important components for successful implementation of any designed solution in this environment. In the worst case, due to heavy network traffic with respect to data migrations across different data centers, the underlying network infrastructure may not be able to transfer data packets from source to destination, resulting in performance degradation. Focusing on all these issues, in this article, we propose a novel SDN-based big data management approach with respect to the optimized network resource consumption such as network bandwidth and data storage units. We analyze various components at both the data and control planes that can enhance the optimized big data analytics across multiple cloud data centers. For example, we analyze the performance of the proposed solution using Bloom-filter-based insertion and deletion of an element in the flow table maintained at the OpenFlow controller, which makes most of the decisions for network traffic classification using the rule-and-action-based mechanism. Using the proposed solution, developers can deploy and analyze real-time traffic behavior for the future big data applications in MCE.",

            "abstract": "The volume, variety, and velocity properties of big data and the valuable information it contains have motivated the investigation of many new parallel data processing systems in addition to the approaches using traditional database management systems (DBMSs). MapReduce pioneered this paradigm change and rapidly became the primary big data processing system for its simplicity, scalability, and fine-grain fault tolerance. However, compared with DBMSs, MapReduce also arouses controversy in processing efficiency, low-level abstraction, and rigid dataflow. Inspired by MapReduce, nowadays the big data systems are blooming. Some of them follow MapReduce's idea, but with more flexible models for general-purpose usage. Some absorb the advantages of DBMSs with higher abstraction. There are also specific systems for certain applications, such as machine learning and stream data processing. To explore new research opportunities and assist users in selecting suitable processing systems for specific applications, this survey paper will give a high-level overview of the existing parallel data processing systems categorized by the data input as batch processing, stream processing, graph processing, and machine learning processing and introduce representative projects in each category. As the pioneer, the original MapReduce system, as well as its active variants and extensions on dataflow, data access, parameter tuning, communication, and energy optimizations will be discussed at first. System benchmarks and open issues for big data processing will also be studied in this survey.",

            "abstract": "Big Data analytics is used in decision making. It involves heavy computation to obtain exact answers. To alleviate this problem, approximate query processing (AQP) was adopted, which provides approximate results with error bounds. The AQP models which have been proposed are supported only by a single database. In an organization, big data is stored in multiple databases that have different data models. This research aims to provide AQP as a middleware solution using query optimization for heterogeneous databases.",

Universities have large datasets available to predict future direction and generate actionable information. An important type of analytics used to improve management processes and to make informed decisions is big data business analytics. State university executive leaders may improve the effectiveness of their decisions by integrating business analytics in the decision-making models. However, there is a need to examine the use of big data business analytics in the decision-making process at the executive leadership level of the selected state universities. Especially in the context of how descriptive, predictive, prescriptive, decisive and basic analytics, and data collection influence the decision-making process at the executive leadership level of the state universities in terms of student retention and graduation rates.",

            "abstract": "This paper advocates for the need to build a Microblogs Data Management System (MDMS) as an end-to-end data management system to support indexing, querying, and analyzing microblogs, e.g., Tweets, comments, or check-in's. We identify a set of characteristics for microblogging environments that are distinguishing from any other data management environment. Then, we propose a system architecture for the first Microblogs Data Management System, which includes indexing, querying, and recovery components. The indexing component is responsible for indexing recent data in memory, indexing older data in disk, and synchronizing the flow of data from memory to disk without affecting the query response time. The querying component is responsible for retrieving the query answer from both memory and disk storage as well as employing online selectivity estimation techniques tuned to the behavior of microblogs data. The recovery module allows for efficiently storing and processing incoming microblogs in memory without worrying about data loss.",

            "abstract": "The world is already into the information age. The huge growth of digital data has overwhelmed the traditional systems and approaches. Big data is touching almost all aspects of our life and the data-driven discovery approach is an emerging paradigm for computing. The ever-growing data provides a tidal wave of opportunities and challenges in terms of data capture, storage, manipulation, management, analysis, knowledge extraction, security, privacy and visualisation. Though the promise of big data seems to be genuine, still a wide gap exists between its potential and realisation. In last few years, there is a huge surge in research efforts in academia as well as industry to have a better understanding of big data. This article discusses the following: (1) big data evolution including a bibliometric study of academic and industry publications pertaining to big data during the period 2000\u20132017, (2) popular open-source big data stream processing frameworks and (3) prevalent research challenges which must be addressed to realise the true potential of big data.",

It is a big challenge for the government to carry out financial market risk management in the big data era.Design/methodology/approachIn this study, a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity-vector autoregression (GARCH-VaR) model is constructed to analyze the big data financial market in the digital economy. Additionally, the correlation test and stationarity test are carried out to construct the best fit model and get the corresponding VaR value.FindingsOwing to the conditional heteroscedasticity, the index return series shows the leptokurtic and fat tail phenomenon. According to the AIC (Akaike information criterion), the fitting degree of the GARCH model is measured. The AIC value difference of the models under the three distributions is not obvious, and the differences between them can be ignored.Originality/valueUsing the GARCH-VaR model can better measure and predict the risk of the big data finance market and provide a reliable and quantitative basis for the current technology-driven regulation in the digital economy.",

The hypotheses testing and analysis were conducted using structural equation modeling.\n\n\nFindings\nThe results reveal that customers\u2019 data gathered from social media produce different effects on knowledge management practices and firms\u2019 innovation capacity. Furthermore, increased innovation capacity turned out to affect customer relationship performance directly, while it contributes to gain better financial performance only when it is used to gain relational outcomes.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe outcomes of the study help firms to develop a clear understanding about which big data retrieved from social media can be useful to improve their knowledge management practices and enhance their innovation capacity. Moreover, by investigating the mediating role of big data knowledge management in the context of social media knowledge acquisition and innovation capacity, this study also extends the mediation variables used to understand the relationship between knowledge capabilities and practices and innovation constructs.\n",

            "abstract": "Purpose \n \n \n \n \nDecision support systems are becoming an indispensable tool for managing complex supply chains. The purpose of this paper is to develop a multi-agent-based supply chain management system that incorporates big data analytics that can exert autonomous corrective control actions. The effects of the system on supply chain agility are explored. \n \n \n \n \nDesign/methodology/approach \n \n \n \n \nFor the development of the architecture of the system, a sequential approach is adopted. First three fundamental dimensions of supply chain agility are identified \u2013 responsiveness, flexibility and speed. Then the organisational design of the system is developed. The roles for each of the agents within the framework are defined and the interactions among these agents are modelled. \n \n \n \n \nFindings \n \n \n \n \nApplications of the model are discussed, to show how the proposed model can potentially provide enhanced levels in each of the dimensions of supply chain agility. \n \n \n \n \nResearch limitations/implications \n \n \n \n \nThe study shows how the multi-agent systems can assist to overcome the trade-off between supply chain agility and complexity of global supply chains. It also opens up a new research agenda for incorporation of big data and semantic web applications for the design of supply chain information systems. \n \n \n \n \nPractical implications \n \n \n \n \nThe proposed information system provides integrated capabilities for production, supply chain event and disruption risk management under a collaborative basis. \n \n \n \n \nOriginality/value \n \n \n \n \nA novel aspect in the design of multi-agent systems is introduced for inter-organisational processes, which incorporates semantic web information and a big data ontology in the agent society.",

            "abstract": "With the advances in communication technologies and the high amount of data generated, collected, and stored, it becomes crucial to manage the quality of this data deluge in an efficient and cost-effective way. The storage, processing, privacy and analytics are the main keys challenging aspects of Big Data that require quality evaluation and monitoring. Quality has been recognized by the Big Data community as an essential facet of its maturity. Yet, it is a crucial practice that should be implemented at the earlier stages of its lifecycle and progressively applied across the other key processes. The earlier we incorporate quality the full benefit we can get from insights. In this paper, we first identify the key challenges that necessitates quality evaluation. We then survey, classify and discuss the most recent work on Big Data management. Consequently, we propose an across-the-board quality management framework describing the key quality evaluation practices to be conducted through the different Big Data stages. The framework can be used to leverage the quality management and to provide a roadmap for Data scientists to better understand quality practices and highlight the importance of managing the quality. We finally, conclude the paper and point to some future research directions on quality of Big Data.",

            "abstract": "With the explosive increase of big data in industry and academic fields, it is important to apply large-scale data processing systems to analyze Big Data. Arguably, Spark is the state-of-the-art in large-scale data computing systems nowadays, due to its good properties including generality, fault tolerance, high performance of in-memory data processing, and scalability. Spark adopts a flexible Resident Distributed Dataset (RDD) programming model with a set of provided transformation and action operators whose operating functions can be customized by users according to their applications. It is originally positioned as a fast and general data processing system. A large body of research efforts have been made to make it more efficient (faster) and general by considering various circumstances since its introduction. In this survey, we aim to have a thorough review of various kinds of optimization techniques on the generality and performance improvement of Spark. We introduce Spark programming model and computing system, discuss the pros and cons of Spark, and have an investigation and classification of various solving techniques in the literature. Moreover, we also introduce various data management and processing systems, machine learning algorithms and applications supported by Spark. Finally, we make a discussion on the open issues and challenges for large-scale in-memory data processing with Spark.",

            "abstract": "Today we create and collect more data than we have in the past. All this data comes from different sources, including social media platforms, our phones and computers, healthcare gadgets and wearable technology, scientific instruments, financial institutions, the manufacturing industry, news channels, and more. When these data are analyzed in a real-time nature, it offers businesses the opportunity to take quick action in business-development processes (B2B, B2C), gain a different perspective, and better understand applications, creating new opportunities. While changing their sales and marketing strategies, businesses are now able to manage the data they collect in real-time to transform themselves, to record them in a healthy way, to analyze and evaluate data-based processes, and to determine their digital transformation roadmaps, their interactions with their customers, sectoral diffraction, application, and analysis. They want to accelerate the transformation processes within the technology triangle. Thus, big data, recently called as small and wide data, is at the center of everything and becomes an important application for digital transformation. Digital transformation helps companies embrace change and stay competitive in an increasingly digital world. The value of big data in manufacturing, independent from sectoral variations, comes from its ability to combine both in an organization\u2019s efforts to both digitize and automate its end-to-end business operations. In this study, the current digitalization and automation applications of one of the plastic injection-based manufacturing companies at scale will be discussed. Presented open-source-based big data analytics platform, DataCone, that increases data processing efficiency, storage optimization, encourages innovation for real time monitorization and analytics, and support new business models in different industry segments will be demonstrated and discussed. Thus, development and applied ML solutions will be discussed providing important prospects for the future.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, the number of Internet of Things and Internet of Everything (IOT/IOE) paradigms has increased significantly. The large number of devices contributed to generate a huge amount of data (Big Data) inserted in Smart City solutions, which are experiencing an explosion of complexity, also due to the increment of protocols, formats and providers. In this perspective it becomes essential to create a data indexing infrastructure that can optimize the performance of the system itself, for creating the so called data shadowing on IOT and other data on cloud. Therefore, it is fundamental to study paradigms to manage the indexing and visual analytics a great variety of data including IOT/IOE. One of the important aspects to be addressed for managing data in the smart city context are: the uniform model, the performance and scalability, response times in research, and the possibilities of performing visual analytic such as data flow analysis and drill down. All these needs imply the creation of a Smart Solution capable of managing and analysing heterogeneous kinds of data, providing a multitude of final applications based on the type of user who requires a certain service. To this end, in this paper, a unified model for IOT/IOE and data ingestion is presented. In addition, two possible architectural solutions have been implemented and compared in terms of performance, resource consumption, reliability and visual analytic tools for data flow. The solutions proposed for data indexing and shadowing have been tested in the context of Snap4City pilot Helsinki and Antwerp for smart city of EC project Select4Cities.",

However, a huge and growing size of spatial data makes it challenging to process the spatial queries efficiently. In this paper we present a lightweight and scalable spatial index for big data stored in distributed storage systems. Experimental results show the efficiency and effectiveness of our spatial indexing technique for different spatial queries.",

            "abstract": "Recent advances in sensor technologies have led to the significant growth of remote sensing data in terms of its volume, velocity, and variety. Remote sensing data are recognized as the big data, which pose the urgent need for new technologies to integrate and manage heterogeneous remote sensing big data. In this paper, a scalable, efficient, distributed data management system is proposed for heterogeneous remote sensing big data integration and management across the distributed environment. In the system, the remote sensing data are stored as NetCDF files. Meanwhile, the corresponding remote sensing metadata are standardized according to the ISO 19115-2:2009 based metadata template. In this way, a unified view of heterogeneous remote sensing data is formed. Two organization models are designed to store massive remote sensing data and its metadata in HDFS and HBase, respectively. Besides, an Elasticsearch-based secondary index is built for HBase to provide users with query ability of metadata contents.",

            "abstract": "Sensor and smart phone technologies present opportunities for data explosion, streaming and collecting from heterogeneous devices every second. Analyzing these large datasets can unlock multiple behaviors previously unknown, and help optimize approaches to city wide applications or societal use cases. However, collecting and handling of these massive datasets presents challenges in how to perform optimized online data analysis `on-the-fly', as current approaches are often limited by capability, expense and resources. This presents a need for developing new methods for data management particularly using public clouds to minimize cost, network resources and on-demand availability. This paper presents an implementation of the lambda architecture design pattern to construct a data-handling backend on Amazon EC2, providing high throughput, dense and intense data demand delivered as services, minimizing the cost of the network maintenance. This paper combines ideas from database management, cost models, query management and cloud computing to present a general architecture that could be applied in any given scenario where affordable online data processing of Big Datasets is needed. The results are presented with a case study of processing router sensor data on the current ESnet network data as a working example of the approach. The results showcase a reduction in cost and argue benefits for performing online analysis and anomaly detection for sensor data.",

            "title": "Milvus: A Purpose-Built Vector Data Management System",
            "abstract": "Recently, there has been a pressing need to manage high-dimensional vector data in data science and AI applications. This trend is fueled by the proliferation of unstructured data and machine learning (ML), where ML models usually transform unstructured data into feature vectors for data analytics, e.g., product recommendation. Existing systems and algorithms for managing vector data have two limitations: (1) They incur serious performance issue when handling large-scale and dynamic vector data; and (2) They provide limited functionalities that cannot meet the requirements of versatile applications. This paper presents Milvus, a purpose-built data management system to efficiently manage large-scale vector data. Milvus supports easy-to-use application interfaces (including SDKs and RESTful APIs); optimizes for the heterogeneous computing platform with modern CPUs and GPUs; enables advanced query processing beyond simple vector similarity search; handles dynamic data for fast updates while ensuring efficient query processing; and distributes data across multiple nodes to achieve scalability and availability. We first describe the design and implementation of Milvus. Then we demonstrate the real-world use cases supported by Milvus. In particular, we build a series of 10 applications (e.g., image/video search, chemical structure analysis, COVID-19 dataset search, personalized recommendation, biological multi-factor authentication, intelligent question answering) on top of Milvus. Finally, we experimentally evaluate Milvus with a wide range of systems including two open source systems (Vearch and Microsoft SPTAG) and three commercial systems. Experiments show that Milvus is up to two orders of magnitude faster than the competitors while providing more functionalities. Now Milvus is deployed by hundreds of organizations worldwide and it is also recognized as an incubation-stage project of the LF AI & Data Foundation.

            "abstract": "Summary \nFarmers have access to many data-intensive technologies to help them monitor and control weeds and pests. Data collection, data modelling and analysis, and data sharing have become core challenges in weed control and crop protection. We review the challenges and opportunities of Big Data in agriculture: the nature of data collected, Big Data analytics and tools to present the analyses that allow improved crop management decisions for weed control and crop protection. Big Data storage and querying incurs significant challenges, due to the need to distribute data across several machines, as well as due to constantly growing and evolving data from different sources. Semantic technologies are helpful when data from several sources are combined, which involves the challenge of detecting interactions of potential agronomic importance and establishing relationships between data items in terms of meanings and units. Data ownership is analysed using the ethical matrix method to identify the concerns of farmers, agribusiness owners, consumers and the environment. Big Data analytics models are outlined, together with numerical algorithms for training them. Advances and tools to present processed Big Data in the form of actionable information to farmers are reviewed, and a success story from the Netherlands is highlighted. Finally, it is argued that the potential utility of Big Data for weed control is large, especially for invasive, parasitic and herbicide-resistant weeds. This potential can only be realised when agricultural scientists collaborate with data scientists and when organisational, ethical and legal arrangements of data sharing are established.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, the advancement in modern technologies has not only resulted in an explosion of huge data sets being captured and recorded in different fields, but also given rise to concerns in the security and protection of data during storage, transmission, processing, and access. The blockchain is a distributed ledger that records transactions in a secure, flexible, verifiable and permanent way. Transactions in a blockchain can be an exchange of an asset, the execution of the terms of a smart contract, or an update to a record. In this paper, we have developed a blockchain access control ecosystem that gives asset owners the sovereign right to effectively manage access control of large data sets and protect against data breaches. The Linux Foundation's Hyperledger Fabric blockchain is used to run the business network while the Hyperledger composer modeling tool is used to implement the smart contracts or transaction processing functions that run on the blockchain network.",

            "abstract": "With recent advancement in cyber-physical systems and technological revolutions, internet of things is the focus of research in industry as well as in academia. IoT is not only a research and technological revolution but in fact a revolution in our daily life. It is considered a new era of smart lifestyle and has a deep impact on everyday errands. Its applications include but are not limited to smart home, smart transportation, smart health, smart security, and smart surveillance. A large number of devices connected in all these application networks generates an enormous amount of data. This leads to problems in data storage, efficient data processing, and intelligent data analytics. In this chapter, the authors discuss the role of big data and related challenges in IoT networks and various data analytics platforms, used for the IoT domain. In addition to this, they present and discuss the architectural model of big data in IoT along with various future research challenges. Afterward, they discuss smart health and smart transportation as a case study to supplement the presented architectural model.",

            "abstract": "The performance gap between compute and storage is fairly considerable. This results in a mismatch between the application needs from storage and what storage can deliver. The full potential of storage devices cannot be harnessed till all layers of I/O hierarchy function efficiently. Despite advanced optimizations applied across various layers along the odyssey of data access, the I/O stack still remains volatile. The problems associated due to the inefficiencies in data management get amplified in Big Data shared resource environments. The Linux OS (host) block layer is the most critical part of the I/O hierarchy, as it orchestrates the I/O requests from different applications to the underlying storage. Unfortunately, despite it\u2019s significance, the block layer, essentially the block I/O scheduler, hasn\u2019t evolved to meet the needs of Big Data. We have designed and developed two contention avoidance storage solutions, collectively known as \u201cBID: Bulk I/O Dispatch\u201d in the Linux block layer specifically to suit multi-tenant, multi-tasking shared Big Data environments. Hard disk drives (HDDs) form the backbone of data center storage. The data access time in HDDs is majorly governed by disk arm movements, which usually occurs when data is not accessed sequentially. Big Data applications exhibit evident sequentiality but due to the contentions amongst other I/O submitting applications, the I/O accesses get multiplexed which leads to higher disk arm movements. BID schemes aim to exploit the inherent I/O sequentiality of Big Data applications to improve the overall I/O completion time by reducing the avoidable disk arm movements. In the first part, we propose a dynamically adaptable block I/O scheduling scheme BID-HDD for disk based storage. BID-HDD tries to recreate the sequentiality in I/O access in order to provide performance isolation to each I/O submitting process. Through trace driven simulation based experiments with cloud emulating MapReduce benchmarks, we show the effectiveness of BID-HDD which results in 28\u201352% lesser time for all I/O requests than the best performing Linux disk schedulers. In the second part, we propose a hybrid scheme BID-Hybrid to exploit SCM\u2019s (SSDs) superior random performance to further avoid contentions at disk based storage. BID-Hybrid is able to efficiently offload non-bulky interruptions from HDD request queue to SSD queue using BID-HDD for disk request processing and multi-q FIFO architecture for SSD. This results in performance gain of 6\u201323% for MapReduce workloads when compared to BID-HDD and 33\u201354% over best performing Linux scheduling scheme. BID schemes as a whole is aimed to avoid contentions for disk based storage I/Os following system constraints without compromising SLAs.",

            "abstract": "For over a decade the term \u201cBig data\u201d has been used to describe the rapid increase in volume, variety and velocity of information available, not just in medical research but in almost every aspect of our lives. As scientists, we now have the capacity to rapidly generate, store and analyse data that, only a few years ago, would have taken many years to compile. However, \u201cBig data\u201d no longer means what it once did. The term has expanded and now refers not to just large data volume, but to our increasing ability to analyse and interpret those data. Tautologies such as \u201cdata analytics\u201d and \u201cdata science\u201d have emerged to describe approaches to the volume of available information as it grows ever larger. New methods dedicated to improving data collection, storage, cleaning, processing and interpretation continue to be developed, although not always by, or for, medical researchers. Exploiting new tools to extract meaning from large volume information has the potential to drive real change in clinical practice, from personalized therapy and intelligent drug design to population screening and electronic health record mining. As ever, where new technology promises \u201cBig Advances,\u201d significant challenges remain. Here we discuss both the opportunities and challenges posed to biomedical research by our increasing ability to tackle large datasets. Important challenges include the need for standardization of data content, format, and clinical definitions, a heightened need for collaborative networks with sharing of both data and expertise and, perhaps most importantly, a need to reconsider how and when analytic methodology is taught to medical researchers. We also set \u201cBig data\u201d analytics in context: recent advances may appear to promise a revolution, sweeping away conventional approaches to medical science. However, their real promise lies in their synergy with, not replacement of, classical hypothesis-driven methods. The generation of novel, data-driven hypotheses based on interpretable models will always require stringent validation and experimental testing. Thus, hypothesis-generating research founded on large datasets adds to, rather than replaces, traditional hypothesis driven science. Each can benefit from the other and it is through using both that we can improve clinical practice.",

            "abstract": "Database management systems offer an efficient way of managing huge amount of data such as financial and healthcare data and he data retrieval from databases requires knowledge of Structured Query Language (SQL). In this paper, an Automatic SQL Generation System is proposed to help users who are inexperienced in querying database with SQL. The proposed SQL generation system reads formatted data items in the query report from the user and converts the data items into SQL statements programmatically with the help of a data model that is pulled from a database. The SQL generation system can handle simple queries composed of a query block with a SELECT statement as well as complex queries composed of multiple query blocks containing multiple SELECT statements. The proposed system is integrated with an NLIDB (Natural Language Interface for Database) system to translate data items (or tokens) extracted from queries in natural languages into SQL query language, and the system is also integrated and adapted with various types of databases and use cases that include financial and healthcare use cases. The experiment results show that the proposed system correctly handles user queries in natural language just like any other neural model based system and more importantly, the proposed SQL generation engine generates SQL queries without syntactic problems with various databases for all queries.",

            "abstract": "Big data is the concept of enormous amounts of data being generated daily in different fields due to the increased use of technology and internet sources. Despite the various advancements and the hopes of better understanding, big data management and analysis remain a challenge, calling for more rigorous and detailed research, as well as the identifications of methods and ways in which big data could be tackled and put to good use. The existing research lacks in discussing and evaluating the pertinent tools and technologies to analyze big data in an efficient manner which calls for a comprehensive and holistic analysis of the published articles to summarize the concept of big data and see field-specific applications. To address this gap and keep a recent focus, research articles published in last decade, belonging to top-tier and high-impact journals, were retrieved using the search engines of Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science that were narrowed down to a set of 139 relevant research articles. Different analyses were conducted on the retrieved papers including bibliometric analysis, keywords analysis, big data search trends, and authors\u2019 names, countries, and affiliated institutes contributing the most to the field of big data. The comparative analyses show that, conceptually, big data lies at the intersection of the storage, statistics, technology, and research fields and emerged as an amalgam of these four fields with interlinked aspects such as data hosting and computing, data management, data refining, data patterns, and machine learning. The results further show that major characteristics of big data can be summarized using the seven Vs, which include variety, volume, variability, value, visualization, veracity, and velocity. Furthermore, the existing methods for big data analysis, their shortcomings, and the possible directions were also explored that could be taken for harnessing technology to ensure data analysis tools could be upgraded to be fast and efficient. The major challenges in handling big data include efficient storage, retrieval, analysis, and visualization of the large heterogeneous data, which can be tackled through authentication such as Kerberos and encrypted files, logging of attacks, secure communication through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS), data imputation, building learning models, dividing computations into sub-tasks, checkpoint applications for recursive tasks, and using Solid State Drives (SDD) and Phase Change Material (PCM) for storage. In terms of frameworks for big data management, two frameworks exist including Hadoop and Apache Spark, which must be used simultaneously to capture the holistic essence of the data and make the analyses meaningful, swift, and speedy. Further field-specific applications of big data in two promising and integrated fields, i.e., smart real estate and disaster management, were investigated, and a framework for field-specific applications, as well as a merger of the two areas through big data, was highlighted. The proposed frameworks show that big data can tackle the ever-present issues of customer regrets related to poor quality of information or lack of information in smart real estate to increase the customer satisfaction using an intermediate organization that can process and keep a check on the data being provided to the customers by the sellers and real estate managers. Similarly, for disaster and its risk management, data from social media, drones, multimedia, and search engines can be used to tackle natural disasters such as floods, bushfires, and earthquakes, as well as plan emergency responses. In addition, a merger framework for smart real estate and disaster risk management show that big data generated from the smart real estate in the form of occupant data, facilities management, and building integration and maintenance can be shared with the disaster risk management and emergency response teams to help prevent, prepare, respond to, or recover from the disasters.",

            "abstract": "With pervasive sensors continuously collecting and storing massive amounts of information, there is no doubt this is an era of data deluge. Learning from these large volumes of data is expected to bring significant science and engineering advances along with improvements in quality of life. However, with such a big blessing come big challenges. Running analytics on voluminous data sets by central processors and storage units seems infeasible, and with the advent of streaming data sources, learning must often be performed in real time, typically without a chance to revisit past entries. Workhorse signal processing (SP) and statistical learning tools have to be re-examined in todays high-dimensional data regimes. This article contributes to the ongoing cross-disciplinary efforts in data science by putting forth encompassing models capturing a wide range of SP-relevant data analytic tasks, such as principal component analysis (PCA), dictionary learning (DL), compressive sampling (CS), and subspace clustering. It offers scalable architectures and optimization algorithms for decentralized and online learning problems, while revealing fundamental insights into the various analytic and implementation tradeoffs involved. Extensions of the encompassing models to timely data-sketching, tensor- and kernel-based learning tasks are also provided. Finally, the close connections of the presented framework with several big data tasks, such as network visualization, decentralized and dynamic estimation, prediction, and imputation of network link load traffic, as well as imputation in tensor-based medical imaging are highlighted.",

            "abstract": "Two-dimensional1 arrays of bi-component structures made of cobalt and permalloy elliptical dots with thickness of 25 nm, length 1 mm and width of 225 nm, have been prepared by a self-aligned shadow deposition technique. Brillouin light scattering has been exploited to study the frequency dependence of thermally excited magnetic eigenmodes on the intensity of the external magnetic field, applied along the easy axis of the elements. Scientific information technology has been developed rapidly. Here, the purposes are to make people's lives more convenient and ensure information management and classification. The machine learning algorithm is improved to obtain the optimized Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) algorithm. Then, an Android-based intelligent support information management system is designed based on LightGBM for the big data analysis and classification management of information in the intelligent support information management system. The system is designed with modules of employee registration and login, company announcement notice, attendance and attendance management, self-service, and daily tools with the company as the subject. Furthermore, the performance of the constructed information management system is analyzed through simulations. Results demonstrate that the training time of the optimized LightGBM algorithm can stabilize at about 100s, and the test time can stabilize at 0.68s. Besides, its accuracy rate can reach 89.24%, which is at least 3.6% higher than other machine learning algorithms. Moreover, the acceleration efficiency analysis of each algorithm suggests that the optimized LightGBM algorithm is suitable for processing large amounts of data; its acceleration effect is more apparent, and its acceleration ratio is higher than other algorithms. Hence, the constructed intelligent support information management system can reach a high accuracy while ensuring the error, with apparent acceleration effect. Therefore, this model can provide an experimental reference for information classification and management in various fields.",

            "abstract": "This paper aims to demonstrate how the integration of netnography and business analytics can support companies in the process of value creation from social big data by leveraging on customer relationship management and customer knowledge management (CKM).,This paper adopts the methodology of a single case study by using desk analysis, netnography and business analytics. The context of analysis has been identified into the case of Aurora Company, a well-known producer of fountain pens.,The case demonstrates how the integration of big data analytics and netnography is relevant for the development of a customer relationship management strategy. The results obtained have been categorized according to the three main categories of customer knowledge, such as knowledge for, from and about customer.,This paper presents implications for the advancement of the theory on CKM by demonstrating, as the acquisition, storage and management of data generated by customers on social media require the adoption of a cross-disciplinary approach resulting from the integration of qualitative and quantitative approaches. The framework is structured as methodological tool to detect knowledge in virtual community.,Practical implications arise for managers and entrepreneurs in terms of value creation from knowledge assets generated on social big data through the management of the customers\u2019 relationship and data-driven innovation patterns.,This paper offers an original contribution of integration of well-established research streams. The focus on the knowledge under the perspectives of information assets for, from and about customers in the debate on value creation and management of big data is an element of value offered by this study in addition to the comprehension of strategies of social customer relationship management as actual initiative embraced by a company in the leveraging of innovation and tradition.",

            "abstract": "Drawing from tenets of the resource-based theory, we propose and test a model that examines the relationship between the application of big data analytics (ABDA) and organizational performance (OP) in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Further, this study examines the mediating role of knowledge management practices (KMP) in relation to the ABDA and OP. Data were collected from respondents working in SMEs through an adapted instrument. This research study adopts the Baron\u2013Kenny approach to test the mediation. The results indicated that the ABDA had a positive and significant impact on OP. Also, KMP had partially mediated the relationship between ABDA and OP in SMEs. The dataset was solely comprised of SMEs from Pakistan administered Kashmir and may not reflect the insights from other regions. Hence limits the generalizability of the results. Findings highlight both strategic and practical implications related to decision making in organizations for top management, particularly in developing countries. This study attempts to contribute to the literature through novel findings and recommendations. These fallouts will help the top management during the key decision-making process and encourage practitioners who seek competitive advantage through enhanced organizational performance in SMEs.",

            "abstract": "With the extensive use of information technology in AAL communication systems, a data management model has recently embodied the 3-V characteristics of big data: volume, velocity, and variety. A lot of work has been done on volume and velocity, but not as much has been reported on variety. To handle the variety of data, universal solutions with acceptable performance are usually much more cost effective than customized solutions. To achieve universality, a basic idea is to first define a universal abstraction that covers a wide range of data types, and then build a universal system for universal abstraction. Traditional database management systems commonly use a multidimensional data type, or feature vectors, as a universal abstraction. However, many new data types in AAL systems cannot be abstracted into multidimensional space. To find a more universal data abstraction and build more universal systems, we propose the concept of big data abstraction, with metric space as a universal abstraction for AAL data types. Furthermore, to demonstrate how metric-space data abstraction works, we survey the state of the art in metric space indexing, a fundamental task in data management. Finally, open research issues are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Industry 4.0 represents the digital evolution of manufacturing, where emerging technologies such as Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) Sisinni et al. (2018), data analytics, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and cyber physical systems Lee et al. (2018) enable operation of industries in a flexible, efficient, and green way. As such, it is of the utmost importance to be able to manage and analyse the huge amount of data originating from the deployed sensors and services, which can be classified as Big Data from the point of view of volume, velocity, variety, veracity, and value (5 V s). Digital factory is a fundamental notion within the Industry 4.0 domain: it comprises a multilayered integration of the factory activities, enabling the product lifecycle stakeholders to collaborate through the use of software solutions. A digital factory can expand outside the company boundaries and offers the opportunity to collaborate on business processes affecting the whole supply chain Bicocchi et al. (2019). Digital Twin (DT) is one of the most prominent technologies for realizing digital factories and Industry 4.0 Tao et al. (2018). A DT is a digital representation of a physical asset (e.g., a machine, a partner organization, a product), which can be employed for 1) querying its status, 2) issuing commands, 3) receiving streaming data, 4) performing prediction tasks, and 5) simulating the effect of specific usage conditions. A digital factory can be represented with the DTs involved in the manufacturing process. The result can be thought of as an heterogeneous data space, populated by the DTs, and a coordination entity in charge of pursuing specific tasks Catarci et al. (2019). Data coming from the DTs can be used by the coordination entity for a wide variety of tasks, including monitoring the status of the process, adapting to sudden or long term changes, improving the process according to specific Key Performance Indicators (KPI), and predicting the evolution of all the assets involved in the manufacturing process. The digital factory data space can include structured, semi-structured and unstructured data with different schemata, vocabularies, and data access technologies. Due to such heterogeneity and to the nature of the involved data, only a small fraction of the existing data management techniques can be directly applied in a digital factory data space. As a consequence, existing approaches struggle to capture the production goal semantic and mainly focus on specific interoperability aspects. Furthermore, existing data modeling frameworks for DTs (either commercial or open-source) do not provide full support for simulation and prediction. The research topic \u201cBig DataManagement in Industry 4.0\u201d includes contributions in several of the aforementioned areas. Authors in Bousdekis and Mentzas (2021) discuss the challenge of integrating traditional enterprise software solutions (e.g., Enterprise Resource Planning systems (ERPs) and Edited and reviewed by: Huan Liu, Arizona State University, United States",

            "abstract": "The massive volume of data that now covers a wide variety of human behaviors offers researchers in psychology an unprecedented opportunity to conduct innovative theory- and data-driven field research. This article is a practical guide to conducting big data research, covering data management, acquisition, processing, and analytics (including key supervised and unsupervised learning data mining methods). It is accompanied by walkthrough tutorials on data acquisition, text analysis with latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling, and classification with support vector machines. Big data practitioners in academia, industry, and the community have built a comprehensive base of tools and knowledge that makes big data research accessible to researchers in a broad range of fields. However, big data research does require knowledge of software programming and a different analytical mindset. For those willing to acquire the requisite skills, innovative analyses of unexpected or previously untapped data sources can offer fresh ways to develop, test, and extend theories. When conducted with care and respect, big data research can become an essential complement to traditional research. (PsycINFO Database Record",

Hadoop-based platform emerges to deal with big data. In Hadoop NameNode is used to store metadata in a single system's memory, which is a performance bottleneck for scale-out. Gluster file system has no performance bottlenecks related to metadata. To achieve massive performance, scalability and fault tolerance for big data analytics, a big data platform is proposed. The proposed big data platform consists of big data storage and big data processing. The Hadoop big data platform and the proposed big data platform are implemented on commodity Linux virtual machines clusters and performance evaluations are conducted. According to the evaluation analysis, the proposed big data platform provides better scalability, fault tolerance, and faster query response time than the Hadoop platform.",

Many predict the emergence of personalized medicine in the near future. We are, however, moving from two-tiered health systems to a two-tiered personalized medicine. Omics facilities are restricted to affluent regions, and personalized medicine is likely to widen the growing gap in health systems between high and low-income countries. This is mirrored by an increasing lag between our ability to generate and analyze big data. Several bottlenecks slow-down the transition from conventional to personalized medicine: generation of cost-effective high-throughput data; hybrid education and multidisciplinary teams; data storage and processing; data integration and interpretation; and individual and global economic relevance. This review provides an update of important developments in the analysis of big data and forward strategies to accelerate the global transition to personalized medicine.",

            "abstract": "Most of the domains of science are facing an explosion in the data that they have to collect and process in order to conduct research. This is true for both: scientific domains dealing with experimental data, e.g. biology, sociology, astronomy etc, but also scientific domains dealing with simulation data, e.g. seismology, physics etc. To maximize the potential outcome of scientific data analysis, respective data management applications need to fulfil the following coarse tasks: fast on-demand data processing, and effective storage and consolidation of diverse data collections. These two tasks are in general hard to realize because of: (a) the big data size, (b) the diversity of data formats, (c) their conceptual dependencies, (d) disperse data locations, and (e) intensive and systematic nature of scientific queries. We present the characteristics of big scientific data collections and their necessities in terms of data management. Based on this discussion, we discuss the structure of a framework for the processing and consolidation of heterogeneous scientific data collections. Such a framework aims to mediate between the user and a set of available data management technologies, such as relational DBMSs, key-value stores and column stores, in order to efficiently direct data management operations (insertions, updates) and especially requests (queries) to the appropriate data management application. The framework aims to distribute, dissect, and schedule data management actions, as well as integrate results, in a way that reduces response time. This entails the accommodation of methods for the selective parallelism and serialization depending on partial results and response times. Also, this entails the accommodation of methods for the gradual alteration of data formats and storage, e.g. storage of semi-structured data or raw data in files into relational databases. Furthermore, we discuss the processing of scientific query bulks or workflows with the possibility to retrieve early partial results and calibrate query parameters.",

            "abstract": "\nPurpose\nBig data analytics (BDA) guarantees that data may be analysed and categorised into useful information for businesses and transformed into big data related-knowledge and efficient decision-making processes, thereby improving performance. However, the management of the knowledge generated from the BDA as well as its integration and combination with firm knowledge have scarcely been investigated, despite an emergent need of a structured and integrated approach. The paper aims to discuss these issues.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThrough an empirical analysis based on structural equation modelling with data collected from 88 Italian SMEs, the authors tested if BDA capabilities have a positive impact on firm performances, as well as the mediator effect of knowledge management (KM) on this relationship.\n\n\nFindings\nThe findings of this paper show that firms that developed more BDA capabilities than others, both technological and managerial, increased their performances and that KM orientation plays a significant role in amplifying the effect of BDA capabilities.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nBDA has the potential to change the way firms compete through better understanding, processing, and exploiting of huge amounts of data coming from different internal and external sources and processes. Some managerial and theoretical implications are proposed and discussed in light of the emergence of this new phenomenon.\n",

            "abstract": "The explosive growth in Big Data has attracted much attention in designing efficient indexing and search methods recently. In many critical applications such as large-scale search and pattern matching, finding the nearest neighbors to a query is a fundamental research problem. However, the straightforward solution using exhaustive comparison is infeasible due to the prohibitive computational complexity and memory requirement. In response, approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search based on hashing techniques has become popular due to its promising performance in both efficiency and accuracy. Prior randomized hashing methods, e.g., locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), explore data-independent hash functions with random projections or permutations. Although having elegant theoretic guarantees on the search quality in certain metric spaces, performance of randomized hashing has been shown insufficient in many real-world applications. As a remedy, new approaches incorporating data-driven learning methods in development of advanced hash functions have emerged. Such learning-to-hash methods exploit information such as data distributions or class labels when optimizing the hash codes or functions. Importantly, the learned hash codes are able to preserve the proximity of neighboring data in the original feature spaces in the hash code spaces. The goal of this paper is to provide readers with systematic understanding of insights, pros, and cons of the emerging techniques. We provide a comprehensive survey of the learning-to-hash framework and representative techniques of various types, including unsupervised, semisupervised, and supervised. In addition, we also summarize recent hashing approaches utilizing the deep learning models. Finally, we discuss the future direction and trends of research in this area.",

            "abstract": "In the age of big data, services in the pervasive edge environment are expected to offer end-users better Quality-of-Experience (QoE) than that in a normal edge environment. However, the combined impact of the storage, delivery, and sensors used in various types of edge devices in this environment is producing volumes of high-dimensional big data that are increasingly pervasive and redundant. Therefore, enhancing the QoE has become a major challenge in high-dimensional big data in the pervasive edge computing environment. In this paper, to achieve high QoE, we propose a QoE model for evaluating the qualities of services in the pervasive edge computing environment. The QoE is related to the accuracy of high-dimensional big data and the transmission rate of this accurate data. To realize high accuracy of high-dimensional big data and the transmission of accurate data through out the pervasive edge computing environment, in this study we focused on the following two aspects. First, we formulate the issue as a high-dimensional big data management problem and test different transmission rates to acquire the best QoE. Then, with respect to accuracy, we propose a Tensor-Fast Convolutional Neural Network (TF-CNN) algorithm based on deep learning, which is suitable for high-dimensional big data analysis in the pervasive edge computing environment. Our simulation results reveal that our proposed algorithm can achieve high QoE performance.",

            "abstract": "Research in data management profits when the performance evaluation is based not only on individual components in isolation, but uses an actual DBMS end-to-end. Facilitating the integration and benchmarking of new concepts within a DBMS requires a simple setup process, well-documented code, and the possibility to execute both standard and custom benchmarks without tedious preparation. Fulfilling these requirements also makes it easy to reproduce the results later on. The relational open-source database Hyrise (VLDB, 2010) was presented to make the case for hybrid rowand column-format data storage. Since then, it has evolved from being a singlepurpose research DBMS towards becoming a platform for various projects, including research in the areas of indexing, data partitioning, and non-volatile memory. With a growing diversity of topics, we have found that the original code base grew to a point where new experimentation became unnecessarily difficult. Over the last two years, we have re-written Hyrise from scratch and built an extensible multi-purpose research DBMS that can serve as an easy-to-extend platform for a variety of experiments and prototyping in database research. In this paper, we discuss how our learnings from the previous version of Hyrise have influenced our re-write. We describe the new architecture of Hyrise and highlight the main components. Afterwards, we show how our extensible plugin architecture facilitates research on diverse DBMS-related aspects without compromising the architectural tidiness of the code. In a first performance evaluation, we show that the execution time of most TPC-H queries is competitive to that of other research databases.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT When using distributed storage systems to store gridded remote sensing data in large, distributed clusters, most solutions utilize big table index storage strategies. However, in practice, the performance of big table index storage strategies degrades as scenarios become more complex, and the reasons for this phenomenon are analyzed in this paper. To improve the read and write performance of distributed gridded data storage, this paper proposes a storage strategy based on Ceph software. The strategy encapsulates remote sensing images in the form of objects through a metadata management strategy to achieve the spatiotemporal retrieval of gridded data, finding the cluster location of gridded data through hash-like calculations. The method can effectively achieve spatial operation support in the clustered database and at the same time enable fast random read and write of the gridded data. Random write and spatial query experiments proved the feasibility, effectiveness, and stability of this strategy. The experiments prove that the method has higher stability than, and that the average query time is 38% lower than that for, the large table index storage strategy, which greatly improves the storage and query efficiency of gridded images.",

            "abstract": "The massive amounts of time series data continuously generated and collected by applications warrant the need for large scale distributed time series processing systems. Indexing plays a critical role in speeding up time series similarity queries on which various analytics and applications rely. However, the state-of-the-art indexing techniques, which are iSAX-based structures, do not scale well due to the small adopted fan-out (binary) that leads to a highly deep index tree, and the expensive search cost through many internal nodes. More seriously, the iSAX character-level cardinality adopted by these indices suffers from a poor maintenance of the proximity relationships among the time series objects, which leads to severe accuracy degradation for approximate similarity queries. In this paper, we propose the TARDIS distributed indexing framework to overcome the aforementioned limitations. TARDIS introduces a novel iSAX index tree that is based on a new word-level variable cardinality. The proposed index ensures compact structure, efficient search and comparison, and good preservation of the similarity relationships. TARDIS is suitable for indexing and querying billion-scale time series datasets. TARDIS is composed of one centralized global index and local distributed indices-one per each data partition across the cluster. TARDIS uses both the global and local indices to efficiently support exact match and kNN approximate queries. The system is implemented using Apache Spark, and extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark and real-world datasets. Evaluation results demonstrate that for over one billion time series dataset (TB scale), the construction of a clustered index is about 83% faster than the existing techniques. Moreover, the average response time of exact match queries is decreased by 50%, and the accuracy of the kNN approximate queries has increased more than 10 fold (from 3% to 40%) compared to the existing techniques.",

As well as the opportunities to support large scale analysis of the collections, this also presents new challenges around data management, storage, rights, formats, skills and access. Furthermore, by assuming the role of both creators and collectors, libraries face broader questions about the concepts of \u2018collections' and \u2018heritage', and the ethical implications of collecting practices. While the \u2018collections as data\u2019 movement has encouraged cultural heritage organisations to present collections in machine-readable formats, new services, processes and tools also need to be established to enable these emerging forms of research, and new modes of working need to be established to take into account an increasing need for transparency around the creation and presentation of digital collections. This commentary explores the National Library of Scotland's new digital scholarship service, the implications of this new activity and the obstacles that libraries encounter when navigating a world of Big Data.",

            "title": "Big Data Processing at Microsoft: Hyper Scale, Massive Complexity, and Minimal Cost",
            "abstract": "The past decade has seen a tremendous interest in large-scale data processing at Microsoft. Typical scenarios include building business-critical pipelines such as advertiser feedback loop, index builder, and relevance/ranking algorithms for Bing; analyzing user experience telemetry for Office, Windows or Xbox; and gathering recommendations for products like Windows and Xbox. To address these needs a first-party big data analytics platform, referred to as Cosmos, was developed in the early 2010s at Microsoft. Cosmos makes it possible to store data at exabyte scale and process in a serverless form factor, with SCOPE [4] being the query processing workhorse. Over time, however, several newer challenges have emerged, requiring major technical innovations in Cosmos to meet these newer demands. In this abstract, we describe three such challenges from the query processing viewpoint, and our approaches to handling them. Hyper Scale. Cosmos has witnessed a significant growth in usage from its early days, from the number of customers (starting from Bing to almost every single business unit at Microsoft today), to the volume of data processed (from petabytes to exabytes today), to the amount of processing done (from tens of thousands of SCOPE jobs to hundreds of thousands of jobs today, across hundreds of thousands of machines). Even a single job can consume tens of petabytes of data and produce similar volumes of data by running millions of tasks in parallel. Our approach to handle this unprecedented scale is two fold. First, we decoupled and disaggregated the query processor from storage and resource management components, thereby allowing different components in the Cosmos stack to scale independently. Second, we scaled the data movement in the SCOPE query processor with quasilinear complexity [2]. This is crucial since data movement is often the most expensive step, and hence the bottleneck, in massive-scale data processing. Massive Complexity. Cosmos workloads are also highly complex. Thanks to adoption across the whole of Microsoft, Cosmos needs to support workloads that are representative of multiple industry segments, including search engine (Bing), operating system (Windows), workplace productivity (Office), personal computing (Surface), gaming (XBox), etc. To handle such diverse workloads, our approach has been to provide a one-size-fits-all experience. First of all, to make it easy for the customers to express their computations, SCOPE supports different types of queries, from batch to interactive to streaming and machine learning. Second, SCOPE supports both structured and unstructured data processing. Likewise, multiple data formats, including both propriety and open source source such as Parquet, are supported. Third, users can write business logic using a mix of declarative and imperative languages, over even different imperative languages such as C# and Python, in the same job. Furthermore, users can express all of the above in simple data flow style computation for better readability and maintainability. Finally, considering the diverse workload mix inside Microsoft, we have come to realization that it is not possible to fits all scenarios using SCOPE. Therefore, we also support the popular Spark query processing engine. Overall, the one-size-fits-all query processing experience in Cosmos covers very diverse workloads, including data formats, programming languages, and the backend engines. Minimal Cost. While scale and complexity are hard by themselves, the biggest challenge is to achieve all of that at minimal cost. In fact, there is a pressing need to improve Cosmos efficiency and reduce operational costs. This is challenging due to several reasons. First, optimizing a SCOPE job is hard considering that the SCOPE DAGs are super large (up to 1000s of operators in single job!), and the optimization estimates (cardinality, cost, etc.) are often way off from the actuals. Second, SCOPE optimizes a given query, while the operational costs depend on the overall workload. Therefore workload optimization becomes very important. And finally, SCOPE jobs are typically interlinked in data pipelines, i.e., the output of one job is consumed by other jobs. This means that workload optimization needs to be aware of these dependencies. Our approach is to develop a feedback loop to learn from past workloads in order to optimize the future ones. Specifically, we leverage machine learning to learn models for optimizing individual jobs [3], apply multi-query optimizations to optimize the costs of overall workload [1], and build dependency graphs to identify and optimize for the data pipelines.",

Current transportation systems struggle to meet different stakeholder expectations while trying their best to optimize resources in providing various transport services. This paper proposes a Microservice-Oriented Big Data Architecture (MOBDA) incorporating data processing techniques, such as predictive modelling for achieving smart transportation and analytics microservices required towards smart cities of the future. We postulate key transportation metrics applied on various sources of transportation data to serve this objective. A novel hybrid architecture is proposed to combine stream processing and batch processing of big data for a smart computation of microservice-oriented transportation metrics that can serve the different needs of stakeholders. Development of such an architecture for smart transportation and analytics will improve the predictability of transport supply for transport providers and transport authority as well as enhance consumer satisfaction during peak periods.",

The rapid development of digital technologies, IoT products and connectivity platforms, social networking applications, video, audio and geolocation services has created opportunities for collecting/accumulating a large amount of data. While in the past corporations used to deal with static, centrally stored data collected from various sources, with the birth of the web and cloud services, cloud computing is rapidly overtaking the traditional in-house system as a reliable, scalable and cost-e\ufb00ective IT solution. The high volumes of structures and unstructured data, stored in a distributed manner, and the wide variety of data sources pose problems related to data/knowledge representation and integration, data querying, business analysis and knowledge discovery. This introductory chapter serves to characterize the relevant aspects of the Big Data Ecosystem with respect to big data characteristics, the components needed for implementing end-to-end big data processing and the need for using semantics for improving the data management, integration, processing, and analytical tasks.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT Earth observations and model simulations are generating big multidimensional array-based raster data. However, it is difficult to efficiently query these big raster data due to the inconsistency among the geospatial raster data model, distributed physical data storage model, and the data pipeline in distributed computing frameworks. To efficiently process big geospatial data, this paper proposes a three-layer hierarchical indexing strategy to optimize Apache Spark with Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) from the following aspects: (1) improve I/O efficiency by adopting the chunking data structure; (2) keep the workload balance and high data locality by building the global index (k-d tree); (3) enable Spark and HDFS to natively support geospatial raster data formats (e.g., HDF4, NetCDF4, GeoTiff) by building the local index (hash table); (4) index the in-memory data to further improve geospatial data queries; (5) develop a data repartition strategy to tune the query parallelism while keeping high data locality. The above strategies are implemented by developing the customized RDDs, and evaluated by comparing the performance with that of Spark SQL and SciSpark. The proposed indexing strategy can be applied to other distributed frameworks or cloud-based computing systems to natively support big geospatial data query with high efficiency.",

            "abstract": "The advances in information technology have witnessed great progress on healthcare technologies in various domains nowadays. However, these new technologies have also made healthcare data not only much bigger but also much more difficult to handle and process. Moreover, because the data are created from a variety of devices within a short time span, the characteristics of these data are that they are stored in different formats and created quickly, which can, to a large extent, be regarded as a big data problem. To provide a more convenient service and environment of healthcare, this paper proposes a cyber-physical system for patient-centric healthcare applications and services, called Health-CPS, built on cloud and big data analytics technologies. This system consists of a data collection layer with a unified standard, a data management layer for distributed storage and parallel computing, and a data-oriented service layer. The results of this study show that the technologies of cloud and big data can be used to enhance the performance of the healthcare system so that humans can then enjoy various smart healthcare applications and services.",

            "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT)-generated data are characterized by its continuous generation, large amount, and unstructured format. The existing relational database technologies are inadequate to handle such IoT-generated data due to the limited processing speed and the significant storage-expansion cost. Thus, big data processing technologies, which are normally based on distributed file systems, distributed database management, and parallel processing technologies, have arisen as a core technology to implement IoT-generated data repositories. In this paper, we propose a sensor-integrated radio frequency identification (RFID) data repository-implementation model using MongoDB, the most popular big data-savvy document-oriented database system now. First, we devise a data repository schema that can effectively integrate and store the heterogeneous IoT data sources, such as RFID, sensor, and GPS, by extending the event data types in electronic product code information services standard, a de facto standard for the information exchange services for RFID-based traceability. Second, we propose an effective shard key to maximize query speed and uniform data distribution over data servers. Last, through a series of experiments measuring query speed and the level of data distribution, we show that the proposed design strategy, which is based on horizontal data partitioning and a compound shard key, is effective and efficient for the IoT-generated RFID/sensor big data.",

The study also examines the ways in which research in supply chain and related fields differ when responding to and managing disruptive change.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis study follows a four-step systematic review process, consisting of literature collection, descriptive analysis, category selection and material evaluation. For the last stage of evaluating relevant issues and trends in the literature, the latent semantic analysis method was adopted using Leximancer, which allows more rapid, reliable and consistent content analysis.\n\n\nFindings\nThe empirical analysis identified key research trends in big data analytics and IoT divided over two time-periods, in which research demonstrated steady growth by 2015 and the rapid growth was shown afterwards. The key finding of this review is that the main interest in recent big data is toward overlapping customer service, support and supply chain network, systems and performance. Major research themes in IoT moved from general supply chain and business information management to more specific context including supply chain design, model and performance.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nIn addition to providing more awareness of this research approach, the authors seek to identify important trends in disruptive technologies research over time.\n",

            "abstract": ": Digitalization of our society brings various new digital ecosystems (e.g., Smart Cities, Smart Buildings, Smart Mobility), which rely on the collection, storage, and processing of Big Data. One of the recently popular advancements in Big Data storage and processing are the graph databases. A graph database is specialized to handle highly connected data, which can be, for instance, found in the cross-domain setting where various levels of data interconnection take place. Existing works suggest that for data with many relationships, the graph databases perform better than non-graph databases. However, it is not clear where are the borders for speci\ufb01c query types, for which it is still ef\ufb01cient to use a graph database. In this paper, we design and perform tests that examine these borders. We perform the tests in a cluster of three machines so that we explore the database behavior in Big Data scenarios concerning the query. We speci\ufb01cally work with Neo4j as a representative of graph databases and PostgreSQL as a representative of non-graph databases.",

Facing the massive campus data, how to extract the hidden and valuable information from it has become an urgent problem for universities to solve. In this project, an user model with five dimensions is proposed, in which include students' basic information, learning ability, consumption level, daily habits and interest preferences. Based on the method of data collection, processing and mining, the students' feature attributes are extracted and student portraits are constructed. Finally, the experimental results show that the student portrait constructed can well describe the digital features of student users, and to a certain extent, provide data basis for decision- making support of teaching management department in universities.",

            "abstract": "Column-oriented stores, known for their scalability and flexibility, are a common NoSQL database implementation and are increasingly used in big data management. In column-oriented stores, a \u201cfull-scan\u201d query strategy is inefficient and the search space can be reduced if data is well partitioned or indexed; however, there is no pre-defined schema for building and maintaining partitions and indexes at lower cost. We leverage an accumulative and high-dimensional data model, a sophisticated linearization algorithm, and an efficient query algorithm, to solve the challenge of how a pre-defined and well-partitioned data model can be applied to flexible and time-varied key-value data. We adapt a high-dimensional array as the data model to partition the key-value data without additional storage and massive calculation; improve the Z-order linearization algorithm, which map multidimensional data to one dimension while preserving locality of the data points, for flexibility; efficiently build an expansion mechanism for the data model to support time-varied data. The result is Haery, a column-oriented store, based on a distributed file system and computing framework. In experiments, Haery is compared with Hive, HBase, Cassandra, MongoDB, PostgresXL, and HyperDex in terms of query performance. With results indicating Haery on average performs 4.57x, 4.23x, 3.55x, 1.79x, 1.82x, and 120.6x faster, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Big Data Systems (Hadoop, DBMSs) require a complicated setup and tuning to store and process big data on a parallel cluster. This is mainly due to static partitioning when data sets are loaded or copied into the file system. Parallel processing thereafter works in a distributed manner, aiming for balanced parallel execution across nodes. Node synchronization, data redistribution and distributed caching in main memory are difficult to tune in the system. On the other hand, there exist analytical problems and algorithms, which can be computed in parallel, with minimal synchronization and fully independent computation. Moreover, some problems can be solved in one pass or few passes. In this paper, we introduce a low cost, yet useful, processing architecture in which data sets are dynamically partitioned at run-time and storage is transient. Each node processes one partition independently and partial results are gathered at the master processing node. Surprisingly, we show this architecture works well for some popular machine learning models as well as some graph algorithms. We attempt to identify which problem characteristics enable such efficient processing, and we also show the main bottleneck is the initial data set partitioning and distribution across nodes. We anticipate our architecture can benefit parallel processing in the cloud, where a dynamic number of virtual processors is decided at runtime or when the data set is analyzed for a short time.",

            "abstract": "Building Information Modeling (BIM) is envisioned as an indispensable opportunity in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industries as a revolutionary technology and process. Smart construction relies on BIM for manipulating information flow, data flow, and management flow. Currently, BIM model has been explored mainly for information construction and utilization, but rare works pay efforts to information security, e.g., critical model audit and sensitive model exposure. Moreover, few BIM systems are proposed to chase after upcoming computing paradigms, such as mobile cloud computing, big data, blockchain, and Internet of Things. In this paper, we make the first attempt to propose a novel BIM system model called bcBIM to tackle information security in mobile cloud architectures. More specifically, bcBIM is proposed to facilitate BIM data audit for historical modifications by blockchain in mobile cloud with big data sharing. The proposed bcBIM model can guide the architecture design for further BIM information management system, especially for integrating BIM cloud as a service for further big data sharing. We propose a method of BIM data organization based on blockchains and discuss it based on private and public blockchain. It guarantees to trace, authenticate, and prevent tampering with BIM historical data. At the same time, it can generate a unified format to support future open sharing, data audit, and data provenance.",

            "abstract": "With the development of digital, information and intelligent process of power system, more and more data sources appear. The traditional standalone environment has been difficult to adapt to the need of the analysis of massive data. The power industry also needs to use real-time database, distributed storage and indexing, data mining and other technologies to achieve massive data storage and data mining. In this paper, a distributed power big data platform, which integrates storage, calculation, mining and analysis functions, is constructed based on the requirement of power industry for mass heterogeneous data processing and analysis. Then, we use Apriori algorithm to analyze residential electricity data based on the big data platform. The experimental results show that the distributed computing framework can greatly improve the efficiency of data processing. At the same time, using data mining technology to analyze residential electricity data can help us find the distribution and change rules of electric load and improve load forecasting ability.",
