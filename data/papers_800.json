            "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks enable dense sensing of the environment, offering unprecedented opportunities for observing the physical world. This article addresses two key challenges in wireless sensor networks: in-network storage and distributed search. The need for these techniques arises from the inability to provide persistent, centralized storage and querying in many sensor networks. Centralized storage requires multihop transmission of sensor data to Internet gateways which can quickly drain battery-operated nodes.Constructing a storage and search system that satisfies the requirements of data-rich scientific applications is a daunting task for many reasons: (a) the data requirements may be large compared to available storage and communication capacity of resource-constrained nodes, (b) user requirements are diverse and range from identification and collection of interesting event signatures to obtaining a deeper understanding of long-term trends and anomalies in the sensor events, and (c) many applications are in new domains where a priori information may not be available to reduce these requirements.This article describes a lossy, gracefully degrading storage model. We believe that such a model is necessary and sufficient for many scientific applications since it supports both progressive data collection for interesting events as well as long-term in-network storage for in-network querying and processing. Our system demonstrates the use of in-network wavelet-based summarization and progressive aging of summaries in support of long-term querying in storage and communication-constrained networks. We evaluate the performance of our linux implementation and show that it achieves: (a) low communication overhead for multiresolution summarization, (b) highly efficient drill-down search over such summaries, and (c) efficient use of network storage capacity through load-balancing and progressive aging of summaries.",

            "abstract": "Complex event processing has become increasingly important in modern applications, ranging from RFID tracking for supply chain management to real-time intrusion detection. A key aspect of complex event processing is to extract patterns from event streams to make informed decisions in real-time. However, network latencies and machine failures may cause events to arrive out-of-order at the event processing engine. State-of-the-art event stream processing technology experiences significant challenges when faced with out-of-order data arrival including output blocking, huge system latencies, memory resource overflow, and incorrect result generation. To address these problems, we propose two alternate solutions: aggressive and conservative strategies respectively to process sequence pattern queries on out-of-order event streams. The aggressive strategy produces maximal output under the optimistic assumption that out-of-order event arrival is rare. In contrast, to tackle the unexpected occurrence of an out-of-order event and with it any premature erroneous result generation, appropriate error compensation methods are designed for the aggressive strategy. The conservative method works under the assumption that out-of-order data may be common, and thus produces output only when its correctness can be guaranteed. A partial order guarantee (POG) model is proposed under which such correctness can be guaranteed. For robustness under spiky workloads, both strategies are supplemented with persistent storage support and customized access policies. Our experimental study evaluates the robustness of each method, and compares their respective scope of applicability with state-of-art methods.",

            "abstract": "Because of increasing use of XML data on the internet, the need for an efficient method of storing and querying XML data is vital. So far, two major types of system for XML data management have been introduced: XML Enabled systems and XML native systems. The former uses relational database system for storing and querying XML data and the latter is a special XML database system which is based on XML data model. Since relational database systems are more mature than XML native systems, it seems that the use of abilities and efficiencies of relational systems is more economical. In this article, we have introduced a new relational schema named XLight for storing and processing XML data, and we have compared it with some similar methods.",

We identify performance limitations in this context, and propose an array of techniques to lift them. First, we adapt the DHT platform's index store and communication primitives to the needs of massive data processing. Second, we introduce a distributed hierarchical index and associated efficient algorithms to speed up query processing. Third, we present an innovative, XML-specific flavor of Bloom filters, to reduce data transfers entailed by query processing. Our approach is fully implemented in the KadoP system, used in a real-life software manufacturing application. Our experiments demonstrate the benefits of the proposed techniques.",

            "abstract": "In XML retrieval, two distinct approaches have been established and pursued without much cross-fertilization taking place so far. On the one hand, native XML databases tailored to the semistructured data model have received considerable attention, and a wealth of index structures, join algorithms, tree encodings and query rewriting techniques for XML have been proposed. On the other hand, the question how to make XML fit the relational data model has been studied in great detail, giving rise to a multitude of storage schemes for XML in relational database systems (RDBSs). In this paper we examine how native XML indexing techniques can boost the retrieval of XML stored in an RDBS. We present the Relational CADG (RCADG), an adaptation of several native indexing approaches to the relational model, and show how it supports the evaluation of a clean formal language of conjunctive XML queries. Unlike relational storage schemes for XML, the RCADG largely preserves the underlying tree structure of the data in the RDBS, thus addressing several open problems known from the literature. Experiments show that the RCADG accelerates retrieval by up to two or even three orders of magnitude compared to both native and relational approaches.",

            "abstract": "Geoscience gives insights into our surroundings and benefits many aspects of our life. Nowadays, with massive sensors deployed to sense all kinds of parameters for environments, tens of billions, even trillions of sensed data are collected and need to be analyzed for surveillance or other purposes. From many perspectives, users always issue queries according to specific spatial and temporal predicates. For these applications, relational databases are overwhelmed by the large scale and high rate insertions, and NoSQL database could be considered a feasible solution. HBase, a popular key-value store system, is capable to solve the storage problem, but fails to provide in-built spatio-temporal querying capability. Many previous works tackle the problem by designing schema, i.e., designing row key and column key formation for HBase, which we don't believe is an effective solution. In this paper, we address this problem from nature level of HBase, and propose an index structure as a built-in component for HBase. STEHIX (Spatio-TEmporal Hbase IndeX) is adapted to two-level architecture of HBase and suitable for HBase to process spatio-temporal queries. It is composed of index in the meta table (the first level) and region index (the second level) for indexing inner structure of HBase regions. Base on this structure, two common queries, range query and kNN query are solved by proposing algorithms, respectively. For achieving load balancing and scalable kNN query, two optimizations are also presented. We implement STEHIX and conduct experiments on real dataset, and the results show our design outperforms a previous work in many aspects.",

            "abstract": "In the Big Data Era, the management of energy consumption by servers and data centers has become a challenging issue for companies, institutions, and countries. In data-centric applications, DBMS are one of the major energy consumers when executing complex queries involving very large databases. Some research has been devoted to this issue, covering both the hardware and software dimensions. Regarding software, several proposals have been outlined, focusing either on analytical cost models to predict energy when executing queries or techniques to save energy. To this date, no research has taken account of energy at the physical design level, a crucial phase in database design. In this paper, we propose a methodology, called Eco-DMW, that integrates the energy dimension into the physical design. To show this integration, we study the case of materialized views, a redundant optimization structure. We first show the place that energy takes throughout this stage of design. A multi-objective formalization of the problem of materialized view selection is given. A genetic algorithm is developed to solve the problem. Intensive experiments are conducted using a mathematical cost model and a real measurement tool dedicated to computing energy. Results show the interest of this proposal to save energy and optimize queries in the presence of the selected materialized views.",

            "abstract": "Recent advances in vehicular communications make it possible to realize vehicular sensor networks, i.e., collaborative environments where mobile vehicles that are equipped with sensors of different nature (from toxic detectors to still/video cameras) interwork to implement monitoring applications. In particular, there is an increasing interest in proactive urban monitoring, where vehicles continuously sense events from urban streets, autonomously process sensed data (e.g., recognizing license plates), and, possibly, route messages to vehicles in their vicinity to achieve a common goal (e.g., to allow police agents to track the movements of specified cars). This challenging environment requires novel solutions with respect to those of more-traditional wireless sensor nodes. In fact, unlike conventional sensor nodes, vehicles exhibit constrained mobility, have no strict limits on processing power and storage capabilities, and host sensors that may generate sheer amounts of data, thus making already-known solutions for sensor network data reporting inapplicable. This paper describes MobEyes, which is an effective middleware that was specifically designed for proactive urban monitoring and exploits node mobility to opportunistically diffuse sensed data summaries among neighbor vehicles and to create a low-cost index to query monitoring data. We have thoroughly validated the original MobEyes protocols and demonstrated their effectiveness in terms of indexing completeness, harvesting time, and overhead. In particular, this paper includes (1) analytic models for MobEyes protocol performance and their consistency with simulation-based results, (2) evaluation of performance as a function of vehicle mobility, (3) effects of concurrent exploitation of multiple harvesting agents with single/multihop communications, (4) evaluation of network overhead and overall system stability, and (5) performance validation of MobEyes in a challenging urban tracking application where the police reconstruct the movements of a suspicious driver, e.g., by specifying the license number of a car.",

            "abstract": "CRM is a strategy that integrates the concepts of Knowledge Management, Data Mining, and Data Warehousing in order to support the organization's decision-making process to retain long-term and profitable relationships with its customers. In this paper, we first present the design implications that CRM poses to data warehousing, and then propose a robust multidimensional starter model that supports CRM analyses. We then present sample CRM queries, test our starter model using those queries and define two measures (% success ratio and CRM suitability ratio) by which CRM models can be evaluated. We finally introduce a preliminary heuristic for designing data warehouses to support CRM analyses. Our study shows that our starter model can be used to analyze various profitability analyses such as customer profitability analysis, market profitability analysis, product profitability analysis, and channel profitability analysis.",

            "abstract": "Graph Database Management Systems provide an effective and efficient solution to data storage in current scenarios where data are more and more connected, graph models are widely used, and systems need to scale to large data sets. In this framework, the conversion of the persistent layer of an application from a relational to a graph data store can be convenient but it is usually an hard task for database administrators. In this paper we propose a methodology to convert a relational to a graph database by exploiting the schema and the constraints of the source. The approach supports the translation of conjunctive SQL queries over the source into graph traversal operations over the target. We provide experimental results that show the feasibility of our solution and the efficiency of query answering over the target database.",

The aquaculture water quality indicators were analyzed by a feedforward error back propagation algorithm (BP neural network) with strong nonlinear mapping capacity, and the complicated nonlinear relations among the parameters of the aquaculture environment were solved. An aquaculture element analysis model was proposed, the Johnson attribute reduction algorithm based on the discernibility matrix was used to optimize the traditional algorithm, and the network convergence speed was increased under a given accuracy. The MapReduece distributed programming model was then used to perform parallel design of the BP neural network algorithm to meet the needs of massive data processing in aquaculture platforms. Also, case studies were performed to analyze the aquaculture element model and the parallel learning algorithm, and the big data framework design and data analysis method are integrated to develop an efficient, fault-tolerant aquaculture data management, mining, visualization big data system.",

            "abstract": "Many data analyzing applications highly rely on timely response from execution, and are referred as time-critical data analyzing applications. Due to frequent appearing of gigantic amount of data and analytical computations, running them on large scale distributed computing environments is often advantageous. The workload of big data applications is often hybrid, i.e., contains a combination of time-critical and regular non-time-critical applications. Resource management for hybrid workloads in complex distributed computing environment is becoming more critical and needs more studies. However, it is difficult to design rule-based approaches best suited for such complex scenarios because many complicated characteristics need to be taken into account.Therefore, we present an innovative reinforcement learning (RL) based resource management approach for hybrid workloads in distributed computing environment. We utilize neural networks to capture desired resource management model, use reinforcement learning with designed value definition to gradually improve the model and use \u03b5-greedy methodology to extend exploration along the reinforcement process. The extensive experiments show that our obtained resource management solution through reinforcement learning is able to greatly surpass the baseline rule-based models. Specifically, the model is good at reducing both the missing deadline occurrences for time-critical applications and lowering average job delay for all jobs in the hybrid workloads. Our reinforcement learning based approach has been demonstrated to be able to provide an efficient resource manager for desired scenarios.",

            "abstract": "For efficient Big Data processing, efficient resource utilization becomes a major concern as large-scale computing infrastructures such as supercomputers or clouds keep growing in size. Naturally, energy and cost savings can be obtained by reducing idle resources. Malleability, which is the possibility for resource managers to dynamically increase or reduce the resources of jobs, appears as a promising means to progress towards this goal. However, state-of-the-art parallel and distributed file systems have not been designed with malleability in mind. This is mainly due to the supposedly high cost of storage decommission, which is considered to involve expensive data transfers. Nevertheless, as network and storage technologies evolve, old assumptions on potential bottlenecks can be revisited. In this study, we evaluate the viability of malleability as a design principle for a distributed file system. We specifically model the duration of the decommission operation, for which we obtain a theoretical lower bound. Then we consider HDFS as a use case and we show that our model can explain the measured decommission times. The existing decommission mechanism of HDFS is good when the network is the bottleneck, but could be accelerated by up to a factor 3 when the storage is the limiting factor. With the highlights provided by our model, we suggest improvements to speed up decommission in HDFS and we discuss open perspectives for the design of efficient malleable distributed file systems.",

While data hoarding over the years has followed the structured-style storage approach, the recent nature of digital content, which is widely unstructured, creates the need to adopt different storage techniques. The NoSQL database systems are therefore proposed to accommodate most of the content being generated today. One of such NoSQL databases that have received significant enterprise adoption is the document-append style storage. The problem however is that, research and tools that can aid data mining tasks from such NoSQL databases is generally lacking. Even though document-append style storages allow data accessibility as web services and over URL/I, building a corresponding data mining tool deviates from the underlying techniques governing web crawlers. Also, existing data mining tools that have been designed for schema-based storages (e.g., RDBMS) are misfits. Hence, our goal in this work is to design a data analytics tool that enables knowledge discovery through information retrieval (i.e., terms) from document-append style storage. Three algorithms for terms extraction are tested which are: the inference-based apriori with a Bayesian component, the hidden Markov model, and the Bernoulli process. Overall, the paper proves the accuracy and speed of each algorithm.",

            "abstract": "Many location-based applications require constant monitoring of k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) queries over moving objects within a geographic area. Existing approaches to this problem have focused on predictive queries, and relied on the assumption that the trajectories of the objects are fully predictable at query processing time. We relax this assumption, and propose two efficient and scalable algorithms using grid indices. One is based on indexing objects, and the other on queries. For each approach, a cost model is developed, and a detailed analysis along with the respective applicability is presented. The object-indexing approach is further extended to multi-levels to handle skewed data. We show by experiments that our grid-based algorithms significantly outperform R-tree-based solutions. Extensive experiments are also carried out to study the properties and evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches under a variety of settings.",

            "abstract": "Benchmarking Big Data solutions has been gaining a lot of attention from research and industry. BigBench is one of the most popular benchmarks in this area which was adopted by the TPC as TPCx-BB. BigBench, however, has key shortcomings. The structured component of the data model is the same as the TPC-DS data model which is a complex snowflake-like schema. This is contrary to the simple star schema Big Data models in real life. BigBench also treats the semi-structured web-logs more or less as a structured table. In real life, web-logs are modeled as key-value pairs with unknown schema. Specific keys are captured at query time - a process referred to as late binding. In addition, eleven (out of thirty) of the BigBench queries are TPC-DS queries. These queries are complex SQL applied on the structured part of the data model which again is not typical of Big Data workloads. In this paper1, we present BigBench V2 to address the aforementioned limitations of the original BigBench. BigBench V2 is completely independent of TPC-DS with a new data model and an overhauled workload. The new data model has a simple structured data model. Web-logs are modeled as key-value pairs with a substantial and variable number of keys. BigBench V2 mandates late binding by requiring query processing to be done directly on key-value web-logs rather than a pre-parsed form of it. A new scale factor-based data generator is implemented to produce structured tables, key-value semistructured web-logs, and unstructured data. We implemented and executed BigBench V2 on Hive. Our proof of concept shows the feasibility of BigBench V2 and outlines different ways of implementing late binding.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, spatial keyword query has attracted wide-spread research attention due to the popularity of the location-based services. To efficiently support the online spatial keyword query processing, the data owners need to outsource their data and the query processing service to cloud platforms. However, the outsourcing services may raise privacy leaking issues because the cloud server on the platforms may not be trusted for both data owners and query users. Therefore, in this work, we first propose and formalize the problem of privacy-preserving boolean spatial keyword query under the widely accepted Known Background Thread Model. And then, we devise a novel privacy-preserving spatial-textual Bloom Filter encoding structure and an encrypted R-tree index. They can maintain both spatial and text information together in a secure way while answering the encrypted spatial keyword queries without the need for data decryption. To further accelerate the query processing, a compressed encrypted index is provided to deal with the challenges of the large dimension expansion and the expensive space consumption in the encrypted R-tree index. In addition, we develop the corresponding algorithms based on the designed index, and present the in-depth security analysis to show our work's satisfaction meeting the strong secure scheme. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our proposed index and algorithms by conducting extensive experiments on four datasets under various system settings.",

            "abstract": "Aggregate Continuous Queries (ACQs) are both a very popular class of Continuous Queries (CQs) and also have a potentially high execution cost. As such, optimizing the processing of ACQs is imperative for Data Stream Management Systems (DSMSs) to reach their full potential in supporting (critical) monitoring applications. For multiple ACQs that vary in window specifications and pre-aggregation filters, existing multiple ACQs optimization schemes assume a processing model where each ACQ is computed as a final-aggregation of a sub-aggregation. In this paper, we propose a novel processing model for ACQs, called Tri Ops, with the goal of minimizing the repetition of operator execution at the sub-aggregation level. We also propose Tri Weave, a Tri Ops-aware multi-query optimizer. We analytically and experimentally demonstrate the performance gains of our proposed schemes which shows their superiority over alternative schemes. Finally, we generalize Tri Weave to incorporate the classical subsumption-based multi-query optimization techniques.",

            "abstract": "Geospatial information plays an important role in environmental modelling, resource management, business operations, and government policy. However, very little or no commonality between formats of various geospatial data has led to difficulties in utilizing the available geospatial information. These disparate data sources must be aggregated before further extraction and analysis may be performed. The objective of this paper is to develop a framework called PlaniSphere, which aggregates various geospatial datasets, synthesizes raw data, and allows for third party customizations of the software. PlaniSphere uses NASA World Wind to access remote data and map servers using Web Map Service (WMS) as the underlying protocol that supports service-oriented architecture (SOA). The results show that PlaniSphere can aggregate and parses files that reside in local storage and conforms to the following formats: GeoTIFF, ESRI shape files, and KML. Spatial data retrieved using WMS from the Internet can create geospatial data sets (map data) from multiple sources, regardless of who the data providers are. The plug-in function of this framework can be expanded for wider uses, such as aggregating and fusing geospatial data from different data sources, by providing customizations to serve future uses, which the capacity of the commercial ESRI ArcGIS software is limited to add libraries and tools due to its closed-source architectures and proprietary data structures. Analysis and increasing availability of geo-referenced data may provide an effective way to manage spatial information by using large-scale storage, multidimensional data management, and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) capabilities in one system.",

ASF can be used to transparently accelerate host workloads by close integration at the middleware data/storage boundary or directly by data intensive applications. We provide an overview of the major components involved in accelerating a parallel file system and a relational database management system, describe some early results, and outline our current research directions.",

The concept of a graph has been around since the late 19$^\\text{th}$ century, however, only in recent decades has there been a strong resurgence in both theoretical and applied graph research in mathematics, physics, and computer science. In applied computing, since the late 1960s, the interlinked table structure of the relational database has been the predominant information storage and retrieval model. With the growth of graph/network-based data and the need to efficiently process such data, new data management systems have been developed. In contrast to the index-intensive, set-theoretic operations of relational databases, graph databases make use of index-free, local traversals. This article discusses the graph traversal pattern and its use in computing.",

            "abstract": "The fast increasing location-dependent applications in mobile devices are manufacturing a plethora of geospatial data. Outsourcing geospatial data storage to a powerful cloud is an economical approach. However, safeguarding data users' location privacy against the untrusted cloud while providing efficient location-aware query processing over encrypted data are in conflict with each other. As a step to reconcile such conflict, we study secure k nearest neighbor (SkNN) queries processing over encrypted geospatial data in cloud computing. We design 2D SkNN (2DSkNN), a scheme achieves both strong provable security and high-efficiency. Our approach employs locality sensitive hashing (LSH) in a dimensional-increased manner. This is a counter-intuitive leverage of LSH since the traditional usage of LSH is to reduce the data dimensionality and solve the so-called \"curse of dimensionality\" problem. We show that increasing the data dimensionality via LSH is indeed helpful to tackle 2DSkNN problem. By LSH-based neighbor region encoding and two-tier prefix-free encoding, we turn the proximity test to be sequential keywords query with a stop condition, which can be well addressed by any existing symmetric searchable encryption (SSE) scheme. We show that 2DSkNN achieves adaptive indistinguishability under chosen-keyword attack (IND2-CKA) secure in the random oracle model. A prototype implementation and experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets confirm the high practicality of 2DSkNN.",

            "abstract": "At Facebook, our data systems process huge volumes of data, ranging from hundreds of terabytes in memory to hundreds of petabytes on disk. We categorize our systems as \u201csmall data\u201d or \u201cbig data\u201d based on the type of queries they run. Small data refers to OLTP-like queries that process and retrieve a small amount of data, for example, the 1000s of objects necessary to render Facebook's personalized News Feed for each person. These objects are requested by their ids; indexes limit the amount of data accessed during a single query, regardless of the total volume of data. Big data refers to queries that process large amounts of data, usually for analysis: trouble-shooting, identifying trends, and making decisions. Big data stores are the workhorses for data analysis at Facebook. They grow by millions of events (inserts) per second and process tens of petabytes and hundreds of thousands of queries per day. In this tutorial, we will describe our data systems and the current challenges we face. We will lead a discussion on these challenges, approaches to solve them, and potential pitfalls. We hope to stimulate interest in solving these problems in the research community.",

To be able to satisfy customer and the big need of information, multiple methods are developed to handle the complexity as well as the huge amount of data in different phases of data lifecycle. We notice for each complicated situation in data lifecycle we focus more particularly to develop storage or Analysis processes. For this reason in this paper, we try to have a different approach to resolve basic issues on targeting the first phase of data lifecycle, which is data collect. We present it as a System of systems, since the complexity of each phase of data lifecycle. In this research, we are interested by the collect system and particularly the process of Creation/Reception of data for which we model the requirements in order to manage smart data at the first level of the cycle. To build this model, we follow a methodology that required three major steps. Starting with requirement identification to defining criterion for each requirement, and in the last step will provide requirement modeling. This research highlight the importance of managing data collect to identify and restrict the issues of big data era.",

            "abstract": "Nowadays, location-based services are proliferating and being widely deployed. For example, a Yelp user can obtain a list of the recommended restaurants near his/her current location. For some small or medium location service providers, they may rely on commercial cloud services, e.g., Dropbox, to store the tremendous geospatial data and deal with a number of user queries. However, it is challenging to achieve a secure and efficient location-based query processing over encrypted geospatial data stored on the cloud. In this paper, we propose the Secure and Efficient Query Processing (SecEQP) scheme to address the secure k nearest neighbor (SkNN) query problem. SecEQP employs the projection function-based approach to code neighbor regions of a given location. Given the codes of two locations, the cloud server only needs to compare whether codes equal or not to check the proximity of the two locations. The codes are further embedded into an indistinguishable Bloom filter tree to build a secure and efficient index. The security of SecEQP is formally proved in the random oracle model. We further prototype SecEQP scheme and evaluate its performance on both real-world and synthetic datasets. Our evaluation results show that SecEQP is a highly efficient approach, e.g., top-10 NN query over 1 million datasets only needs less than 40 msec to get queried results.",

            "abstract": "The RDF framework is the underpinning element of Semantic Web stack, its widespread adoption requires efficient tools to store and query RDF data. A number of efficient local RDF stores already exist, while distributed indexing and distributed query processing are only starting to develop, furthermore dynamically growing and fail-safe solutions are not yet available. To remedy this situation, we propose an approach for efficient and scalable query processing over RDF graphs, distributed over a local data grid. Our system is based on a distributed architecture, where neither single point of failure nor specialised nodes exist. The query processing framework, presented in the paper, includes a sophisticated query planning and query execution algorithm, which is designed expressively for storage and query of a stream of incoming RDF triples, allowing the users to register queries that will be notified in real time of new relevant data. We finally evaluate our approach through performance measurement of a real deployment in the areas of business process monitoring.",

            "abstract": "We study the problem of continuous monitoring of top-k queries over multiple non-synchronized streams. Assuming a sliding window model, this general problem has been a well addressed research topic in recent years. Most approaches, however, assume synchronized streams where all attributes of an object are known simultaneously to the query processing engine. In many streaming scenarios though, different attributes of an item are reported in separate non-synchronized streams which do not allow for exact score calculations. We present how the traditional notion of object dominance changes in this case such that the k dominance set still includes all and only those objects which have a chance of being among the top-k results in their life time. Based on this, we propose an exact algorithm which builds on generating multiple instances of the same object in a way that enables efficient object pruning. We show that even with object pruning the necessary storage for exact evaluation of top-k queries is linear in the size of the sliding window. As data should reside in main memory to provide fast answers in an online fashion and cope with high stream rates, storing all this data may not be possible with limited resources. We present an approximate algorithm which leverages correlation statistics of pairs of streams to evict more objects while maintaining accuracy. We evaluate the efficiency of our proposed algorithms with extensive experiments.",

            "abstract": "In the Big Data era, the ever-increasing RDF data have reached a scale in billions of triples and brought obstacles and challenges to single-node RDF data stores. As a result, many distributed RDF stores have been emerging in the Semantic Web community recently. However, currently published ones are either not enough efficient on performance or failed to achieve flexible scalability. In this paper, we propose Rainbow, a scalable and efficient RDF triple store. The RDF data indexing scheme in Rainbow is a hybrid one which is designed based on the statistical analysis of user query space. Further, to better support the hybrid indexing scheme, Rainbow adopts a distributed and hierarchical storage architecture that uses HBase as the scalable persistent storage and combines a distributed memory storage to speedup query performance. The RDF data in memory storage is partitioned by the consistent hashing algorithm to achieve the dynamic scalability. Experiments show that Rainbow outperforms typical existing distributed RDF triple stores, with excellent scalability and fault tolerance.",

With the help of collected public opinion from social media, users are transforming themselves into a social sensor. Data produced by social media is believed can be important in understanding the public's reactions and feelings. Particularly for disaster management, finding posts that indicate a situation of dissatisfaction, danger or worrying may prove critical. Consequently, a systematic classification is genuinely helpful in processing these posts and classify them into sentiment polarity and aspect-based classification that will benefit diverse agencies such as non-government or government in managing such crisis situations. However, there is less work of other researchers in developing big data application using a systematic method such as methodology. Distinctly, in disaster management system that exploits sentiment analysis. Based on ATHENA project, this work extends the Crisis Information Processing Centre component by using supervised learning technique of machine learning approach with the incorporation of RUP/SOMA methodology.",

            "abstract": "Cloud computing is empowering new innovations for big data. At the heart, cloud analytic applications become the most-hyped revolution. Cloud analytic applications have remarkable benefits for big data processing, making it easy, fast, scalable and cost-effective; albeit, they pose many security risks. Security breaches due to malicious, vulnerable, or misconfigured analytic applications are considered the top security risks to big data. The risk is further expanded from the coupling of data analytics with the cloud. Effective security measures, delivered by cloud analytic providers, to detect such malicious and anomalous activities are still missing. This paper presents real-time security monitoring as a service (SMaaS). SMaaS is a novel framework that aims to detect security anomalies in cloud analytical applications running on Hadoop clusters. It aims to detect vulnerable, malicious, and misconfigured applications which violate data integrity and confidentiality. Towards achieving this goal, we are motivated by leveraging big data pipeline that mixes advanced software technologies (Apache NiFi, Hive, and Zeppelin) to automate the collection, management, analysis, and visualization of log data from multiple sources, making it cohesive and comprehensive for security inspection. SMaaS monitors a candidate application by collecting log data on real-time. Then, it leverages log data analysis to model the application's execution in terms of information flow. The information flow model is crucial for profiling processing activities conducted throughout the application's execution. Such model, in turn, enriches the detection of various types of security anomalies. We evaluate the detection effectiveness and performance efficiency of our framework. The experiments are conducted over benchmark applications. The evaluation results demonstrate that our system is a viable solution, yet very efficient. Our system does not make modification in the monitored cluster, nor does it impose overhead to the monitored cluster's performance.",

            "abstract": "The rapid growth of big spatial data urged the research community to develop several big spatial data systems. Regardless of their architecture, one of the fundamental requirements of all these systems is to spatially partition the data efficiently across machines. The core challenges of big spatial partitioning are building high spatial quality partitions while simultaneously taking advantages of distributed processing models by providing load balanced partitions. Previous works on big spatial partitioning are to reuse existing index search trees as-is, e.g., the R-tree family, STR, Kd-tree, and Quad-tree, by building a temporary tree for a sample of the input and use its leaf nodes as partition boundaries. However, we show in this paper that none of those techniques has addressed the mentioned challenges completely. This paper proposes a novel partitioning method, termed R*-Grove, which can partition very large spatial datasets into high quality partitions with excellent load balance and block utilization. This appealing property allows R*-Grove to outperform existing techniques in spatial query processing. R*-Grove can be easily integrated into any big data platforms such as Apache Spark or Apache Hadoop. Our experiments show that R*-Grove outperforms the existing partitioning techniques for big spatial data systems. With all the proposed work publicly available as open source, we envision that R*-Grove will be adopted by the community to better serve big spatial data research.",

Ensuring security and privacy for data management and query processing in the cloud is critical for better and broader uses of the cloud. This tutorial covers recent research on cloud security and privacy, while focusing on the works that protect data confidentiality and query access privacy for sensitive data being stored and queried in the cloud. We provide a comprehensive study of state-of-the-art schemes and techniques for protecting data confidentiality and access privacy, and explain their tradeoffs in security, privacy, functionality and performance.",

            "abstract": "The topic of managing uncertain data has been explored in many ways. Different methodologies for data storage and query processing have been proposed. As the availability of management systems grows, the research on analytics of uncertain data is gaining in importance. Similar to the challenges faced in the field of data management, algorithms for uncertain data mining also have a high performance degradation compared to their certain algorithms. To overcome the problem of performance degradation, the MCDB approach was developed for uncertain data management based on the possible world scenario. As this methodology shows significant performance and scalability enhancement, we adopt this method for the field of mining on uncertain data. In this paper, we introduce a clustering methodology for uncertain data and illustrate current issues with this approach within the field of clustering uncertain data.",

Many of these applications involve database systems to store and process data from the physical world. This data has inherent measurement uncertainties that are properly represented by continuous probability distribution functions (PDFs). We introduce a new object-relational abstract data type (ADT) - the Gaussian ADT (GADT) - that models physical data as Gaussian PDFs, and we show that existing index structures can be used as fast access methods for GADT data. We also present a measurement-theoretic model of probabilistic data and evaluate GADT in its light.",

            "abstract": "Currently, immense quantities of data cannot be managed by traditional database management systems. Instead, they must be managed by big data solutions using shared nothing architectures. Data warehouse systems are systems that address very large amounts of information. The most prominent data warehouse model is star schema, which consists of a fact table and some number of dimension tables. It is necessary to join the facts and dimensions for query executions on the data warehouse. In shared nothing architecture, all of the required information is not placed on a single node so it is necessary to retrieve information from other nodes, which causes network congestion and low speeds of query execution. To avoid this problem and achieve maximum parallelism, dimensions can be replicated over nodes if they are not too large. However, if there are dimensions with data volumes greater than the capacity of a node or dimensions where the data volume summation exceeds node capacity, the query execution is confronted with serious problems. In big data problems, the amount of data is immense, and thus replicating immense data cannot be considered an appropriate method. In this paper, we propose a method called Chabok, which uses two-phased Map-Reduce to solve the data warehouse problem. In this method, aggregation is performed completely on Mappers, and intermediate results are sent to the Reducer. Chabok does not need data replication for join omission. The proposed method was implemented on Hadoop, and TPC-DS queries were executed for benchmarking. The query execution time on Chabok surpassed prominent big data products for data warehousing.",

            "abstract": "In the Cloud era, data is generated everywhere, how to efficiently analyze those \"Big Data\" that have properties such as large volume, fast generation, and variety, are most critical issues. MapReduce is a simplified distributed parallel data processing model. It has been widely applied in many areas such as web indexing, clustering and classification. However, when it confronted the sensitive data, such as network log or mails, which are distributed among independent organizations, these data must keep privacy and cannot be aggregated for centralized analyzing. We propose Federated MapReduce (Fed-MR), a framework aimed at analyzing geometrically distributed data among independent organizations while avoiding data movement. In contrast to previous works, Fed-MR retains the simplicity of MapReduce programming eto provide a transparent way to run original MapReduce jobs across multiple clusters without any extra programming burden. Fed-MR also integrates multiple clusters in different locations to form hierarchical Top-Region relationships. Experiments, compared to a single cluster with the same number of worker nodes, had shown that the computation time was only increased by an average of 30% in WordCount and 10% in Grep. Therefore, Fed-MR has reasonable overheads in performance for analyzing data across Internet-connected clusters while no additional Global Reduce function was required as in traditional hierarchical MapReduce frameworks.",

            "abstract": "In summary, the core design of B-trees has remained unchanged in 40 years: balanced trees, pages or other units of I/O as nodes, efficient root-to-leaf search, splitting and merging nodes, etc. On the other hand, an enormous amount of research and development has improved every aspect of B-trees including data contents such as multi-dimensional data, access algorithms such as multi-dimensional queries, data organization within each node such as compression and cache optimization, concurrency control such as separation of latching and locking, recovery such as multi-level recovery, etc. Gray and Reuter believed in 1993 that \u201cB-trees are by far the most important access path structure in database and file systems.\u201d It seems that this statement remains true today. B-tree indexes are likely to gain new importance in relational databases due to the advent of flash storage. Fast access latencies permit many more random I/O operations than traditional disk storage, thus shifting the break-even point between a full-bandwidth scan and a B-tree index search, even if the scan has the benefit of columnar database storage. We hope that this tutorial of B-tree techniques will stimulate research and development of modern B-tree indexing techniques for future data management systems.",

            "abstract": "It is nowadays quite common for road networks to have textual contents on the vertices, which describe auxiliary information (e.g., business, traffic, etc.) associated with the vertex. In such road networks, which are modelled as weighted undirected graphs, each vertex is associated with one or more keywords, and each edge is assigned with a weight, which can be its physical length or travelling time. In this paper, we study the problem of keyword-aware continuous k nearest neighbour (KCkNN) search on road networks, which computes the k nearest vertices that contain the query keywords issued by a moving object and maintains the results continuously as the object is moving on the road network. Reducing the query processing costs in terms of computation and communication has attracted considerable attention in the database community with interesting techniques proposed. This paper proposes a framework, called a Labelling AppRoach for Continuous kNN query (LARC), on road networks to cope with KCkNN query efficiently. First we build a pivot-based reverse label index and a keyword-based pivot tree index to improve the efficiency of keyword-aware k nearest neighbour (KkNN) search by avoiding massive network traversals and sequential probe of keywords. To reduce the frequency of unnecessary result updates, we develop the concepts of dominance interval and region on road network, which share the similar intuition with safe region for processing continuous queries in Euclidean space but are more complicated and thus require more dedicated design. For high frequency keywords, we resolve the dominance interval when the query results changed. In addition, a path-based dominance updating approach is proposed to compute the dominance region efficiently when the query keywords are of low frequency. We conduct extensive experiments by comparing our algorithms with the state-of-the-art methods on real data sets. The empirical observations have verified the superiority of our proposed solution in all aspects of index size, communication cost and computation time.",

            "abstract": "We study the effects of compression on bitmap indexes. The main operations on the bitmaps during query processing are bitwise logical operations. Using the general purpose compression schemes the logical operations on the compressed bitmaps are much slower than on the uncompressed bitmaps. Specialized compression schemes, like the byte-aligned bitmap code (BBC), are usually faster in performing logical operations than the general purpose schemes, but in many cases they are still orders of magnitude slower than the uncompressed scheme. To make the compressed bitmap indexes operate more efficiently, we designed a CPU-friendly scheme which we refer to as the word-aligned hybrid code (WAH). Tests on both synthetic and real application data show that the new scheme significantly outperforms well-known compression schemes at a modest increase in storage space. Compared to BBC, WAH performs logical operations about 12 times faster and uses only 60% more space. Compared to the uncompressed scheme, in most test cases WAH is faster while still using less space. We further verified with additional tests that the improvement in logical operation speed translates to similar improvement in query processing speed.",

            "abstract": "We demonstrate bdbms, an extensible database engine for biological databases, bdbms started on the observation that database technology has not kept pace with the specific requirements of biological databases and that several needed key functionalities are not supported at the engine level. While bdbms aims at supporting several of these functionalities, this demo focuses on: (1) Annotation and provenance management including storage, indexing, querying, and propagation, (2) Local dependency tracking of dependencies and derivations among data items, and (3) Update authorization to support data curation. We demonstrate how bdbms enables biologists to manipulate their databases, annotations, and derivation information in a unified database system using the Purdue ionomics information management system (PiiMS) as a case study.",

            "abstract": "Two major approaches have been proposed to efficiently process queries in databases: speeding up the search by using index structures, and speeding up the search by operating on a compressed database, such as a signature file. Both approaches have their limitations: indexing techniques are inefficient in extreme configurations, such as high-dimensional spaces, where even a simple scan may be cheaper than an index-based search. Compression techniques are not very efficient in all other situations. We propose to combine both techniques to search for nearest neighbors in a high-dimensional space. For this purpose, we develop a compressed index, called the IQ-tree, with a three-level structure: the first level is a regular (flat) directory consisting of minimum bounding boxes, the second level contains data points in a compressed representation, and the third level contains the actual data. We overcome several engineering challenges in constructing an effective index structure of this type. The most significant of these is to decide how much to compress at the second level. Too much compression will lead to many needless expensive accesses to the third level. Too little compression will increase both the storage and the access cost for the first two levels. We develop a cost model and an optimization algorithm based on this cost model that permits an independent determination of the degree of compression for each second level page to minimize expected query cost. In an experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that the IQ-tree shows a performance that is the \"best of both worlds\" for a wide range of data distributions and dimensionalities.",

            "abstract": "Location-based services (LBSs), considered as a killer application in the wireless data market, provide information based on locations specified in the queries. In this paper, we examine the indexing issue for querying location-dependent data in wireless LBSs; in particular, we focus on an important class of queries, planar point queries. To address the issues of responsiveness, energy consumption, and bandwidth contention in wireless communications, an index has to minimize the search time and maintain a small storage overhead. It is shown that the traditional point-location algorithms and spatial index structures fail to achieve either objective or both. This paper proposes a new index structure, called D-tree, which indexes spatial regions based on the divisions that form the boundaries of the regions. We describe how to construct a binary D-tree index, how to process queries based on the D-tree, and how to page the binary D-tree. Moreover, two parameterized methods for partitioning the original space, called fixed grid assignment (FGA) and adaptive grid assignment (AGA), are proposed to enhance the D-tree. The performance of the D-tree is evaluated using both synthetic and real data sets. Experimental results show that the proposed D-tree outperforms the well-known indexes such as the R/sup */-tree, and that both the FGA and AGA approaches can achieve different performance trade-offs between the index search time and storage overhead by fine-tuning their algorithmic parameters.",

            "abstract": "Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) applications are set to play an essential role in object tracking and supply chain management systems. In the near future, it is expected that every major retailer will use RFID systems to track the movement of products from suppliers to warehouses, store backrooms and eventually to points of sale. The volume of information generated by such systems can be enormous as each individual item (a pallet, a case, or an SKU) will leave a trail of data as it moves through different locations. As a departure from the traditional data cube, we propose a new warehousing model that preserves object transitions while providing significant compression and path-dependent aggregates, based on the following observations: (1) items usually move together in large groups through early stages in the system (e.g., distribution centers) and only in later stages (e.g., stores) do they move in smaller groups, and (2) although RFID data is registered at the primitive level, data analysis usually takes place at a higher abstraction level. Techniques for summarizing and indexing data, and methods for processing a variety of queries based on this framework are developed in this study. Our experiments demonstrate the utility and feasibility of our design, data structure, and algorithms.",

            "abstract": "The need to efficiently store and query large scale graph datasets is evident in the growing number of data-intensive applications, particularly to maximize the mining of intelligence from these data (e.g., to inform decision making). However, directly releasing graph dataset for analysis may leak sensitive information of an individual even if the graph is anonymized, as demonstrated by the re-identification attacks on the DBpedia datasets. A key challenge in the design of graph sanitization methods is scalability, as existing execution models generally have significant memory requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"ding-ieq1-2931903.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula>-decomposition algorithm and define a new information loss matrix designed for utility measurement in massively large graph datasets. We also propose a novel privacy preserving framework that can be seamlessly integrated with graph storage, anonymization, query processing, and analysis. Our experimental studies show that the proposed solution achieves privacy-preserving, utility, and efficiency.",

The video data model of WVTDB is based on multi-level video data abstractions and annotation layering, thus allowing dynamic and incremental video annotation and indexing, multi-user view sharing and video data reuse. Users can query, retrieve and browse video data based on their semantic content descriptions and temporal constraints on the video segments. WVTDB employs a modular system architecture that supports distributed video query processing and subquery caching. Several techniques, such as video wrappers and lazy delivery, are also proposed specifically to address the network bandwidth limitations for this kind of Web-based system. We also address adaptivity, data access control and user profile issues.",

Important parts like query processing, failure recovery, memory management are implemented in generic code, so access method developer has to implement only specifics of the desired algorithm. But this generality comes with a significant cost of fitting a method for GiST API. In this paper we present number of tweaks to the R-tree implementation inside PostgreSQL GiST framework and analyze possible ways of GiST API advancements.",

            "abstract": "Cloud-based infrastructures enable applications to collect and analyze massive amounts of data. Whether these applications are newly developed or they are being evolved from existing RDBMS-based implementations, NoSQL databases offer an attractive platform with which to address this challenge. However, developers find it difficult to effectively manage data in NoSQL databases, because these platforms do not offer much support for data organization. Since poor data organization may abuse the features of the NoSQL database and result in unsatisfactory performance, developing a systematic method for NoSQL database data-schema design is a timely and important problem. In this paper, we focus on geospatial applications, as a family of big-data systems with distinct data types and usage patterns, in need of scalability. We propose the HGrid data model for HBase, based on a hybrid index structure, combining a quad-tree and a regular grid as primary and secondary indices correspondingly. We have comparatively evaluated the performance of HGrid with uniform and skewed data, against two other data models based on quad-tree and regular-grid indices. Our results demonstrate that HGrid scales well and supports efficient performance for range and k-nearest neighbor queries. Although this model does not outperform all its competitors in terms of query response time, it is more flexible for discontinuous and skewed space, and its index requires less space than the corresponding quad-tree and regular-grid indices, which makes its deployment possible with less resources. Through this study, we also formulate a set of guidelines on how to organize data for geospatial applications in HBase.",

            "abstract": "Model-based views have recently been proposed as an effective method for querying noisy sensor data. Commonly used models from the AI literature (e.g., the hidden Markov model) expose to applications a stream of probabilistic and correlated state estimates computed from the sensor data. Many applications want to detect sophisticated patterns of states from these Markovian streams. Such queries are called event queries. In this paper, we present a new Markovian stream storage manager, Caldera. We develop and evaluate Caldera as a component of Lahar, a Markovian stream event query processing system developed in previous work. At the heart of Caldera is a set of access methods for Markovian streams that can improve event query performance by orders of magnitude compared to existing techniques, which must scan the entire stream. Our access methods use new adaptations of traditional B+ tree indexes, and a new index, called the Markov-chain index. They efficiently extract only the relevant timesteps from a stream, while retaining the stream's Markovian properties. We have implemented our prototype system on BDB and demonstrate its effectiveness on both synthetic data and real data from a building-wide RFID deployment.",

            "abstract": "The remarkable growth in digital data is changing what and how the defense against the unknown will take place. Big data is a technical term used today to represent this massive growth of digital data that's being created from many sources. Organizations have turned their attentions to the deployment of Big Data analytics to gain valuable insights that benefit their businesses within protected and secure environments. Hence, network security protocols, especially authentication protocols, are being re-designed to protect and to deliver the real benefits of this data growth. Contrary to the traditional perspective, in which researchers are focusing on identifying users' identity to protect Big Data-based environments, we have an opposite perspective that the Big Data itself would be the fuel for the next generation authentication. In other word, the main goal of this work is to propose a new framework for user authentication that leverages Big Data analytics. The core idea of this framework is to find out unique patterns of the users' dynamic behaviors. The proposed framework comprised of three main components. Data Security-based Analytics (DSA); describing the best utilization of the high velocity data streams, which is capable for distinguishing data that has security/identification potentials. Human dynamics measure engine; that develops an ambitious transformation from the Big Data characteristics into the relevant human dynamics measures. Big data-driven authentication service; describes the required engines to design software as a service-based authentication model. Our investigation shows that this new approach will help create a highly distributed authentication model, minimizing the storage of secrets, and lesser secret management overhead.",

A critical challenge of scaling computational MSA to big data regimes is integrating the core learning algorithms with big data storage modes and data models. To address this challenge, we report results from our experimentation with MongoDB, a NoSQL document-based database which we test as a supporting platform for computational MSA. We experiment with a document model that avoids database joins when linking position and voyage AIS vessel information and allows tuning the database index and document sizes in response to the AIS data rate. We report results for the AIS data ingested and analyzed daily at the NATO Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE).",

This becomes one of the most important and widely discussed issues in the data science community. The system analysis methods and data mining techniques are able to sustain the solution of this problem. This paper presents an innovative holistic hardware/software system (HSS) developed for efficient management and intellectual analysis of geomagnetic data, registered by Russian geomagnetic observatories and international satellites. Geomagnetic observatories that comprise the International Real-time Magnetic Observatory Network (INTERMAGNET) produce preliminary (raw) and definitive (corrected) geomagnetic data of the highest quality. The designed system automates and accelerates routine production of definitive data from the preliminary magnetograms, obtained by Russian observatories, due to implemented algorithms that involve artificial intelligence elements. The HSS is the first system that provides sophisticated automatic detection and multi-criteria classification of extreme geomagnetic conditions, which may be hazardous for technological infrastructure and economic activity in Russia. It enables the online access to digital geomagnetic data, its processing results and modelling calculations along with their visualization on conventional and spherical screens. The concept of the presented system agrees with the accepted \u2018four Vs\u2019 paradigm of Big Data. The HSS can increase significantly the \u2018velocity\u2019 and \u2018veracity\u2019 features of the INTERMAGNET system. It also provides fusion of large sets of ground-based and satellite geomagnetic data, thus facilitating the \u2018volume\u2019 and \u2018variety\u2019 of handled data.",

            "abstract": "Recently, cloud computing has been spotlighted as a new paradigm of database management system. In this environment, databases are outsourced and deployed on a service provider in order to reduce cost for data storage and maintenance. However, the service provider might be untrusted so that the two issues of data security, including data confidentiality and query result integrity, become major concerns for users. Existing bucket-based data authentication methods have problem that the original spatial data distribution can be disclosed from data authentication index due to the unsophisticated data grouping strategies. In addition, the transmission overhead of verification object is high. In this paper, we propose a privacy-aware query authentication which guarantees data confidentiality and query result integrity for users. A periodic function-based data grouping scheme is designed to privately partition a spatial database into small groups for generating a signature of each group. The group signature is used to check the correctness and completeness of outsourced data when answering a range query to users. Through performance evaluation, it is shown that proposed method outperforms the existing method in terms of range query processing time up to 3 times.",

            "abstract": "Many scientific applications generate massive volumes of data through observations or computer simulations, bringing up the need for effective indexing methods for efficient storage and retrieval of scientific data. Unlike conventional databases, scientific data is mostly read-only and its volume can reach to the order of petabytes, making a compact index structure vital. Bitmap indexing has been successfully applied to scientific databases by exploiting the fact that scientific data are enumerated or numerical. Bitmap indices can be compressed with valiants of run length encoding for a compact index structure. However even this may not be enough for the enormous data generated in some applications such as high energy physics. In this paper, we study how to reorganize bitmap tables for improved compression rates. Our algorithms are used just as a preprocessing step, thus there is no need to reuse the current indexing techniques and the query processing algorithms. We introduce the tuple reordering problem, which aims to reorganize database tuples for optimal compression rates. We propose Gray code ordering algorithm for this NP-Complete problem, which is an in-place algorithm, and runs in linear time in the order of the size of the database. We also discuss how the tuple reordering problem can be reduced to the traveling salesperson problem. Our experimental results on real data sets show that the compression ratio can be improved by a factor of 2 to 10.",

            "abstract": "Graph database systems are getting a lot of attention in recent times from the big data management community due to their efficiency in graph data storage andpowerful graph query specification abilities. In this paper we present a methodology for modeling workload spikes in a graph database system using a scalable benchmarking framework called XGDBench. We describe how two main types of workload spikes called data spikes and volume spikes can be implemented in the context of graph databases by considering realworld workload traces and empirical evidence.We implemented these features on XGDBench which we developed using X10. We validated these features by running workloads on Titan which is a popular open source distributed graph database server.We observed the ability of XGDBench in generating realistic workload spikes on Titan. The distributed architecture of XGDBench promotes implementation of such techniques efficiently through utilization of computing power offered by distributed memory compute clusters.",

The goal of this project is to develop a system and associated tools for the management of large quantities of heterogeneous multimedia information. Garlic permits traditional and multimedia data to he stored in a variety of existing data repositories, including databases, files, text managers, image managers, video servers, and so on; the data is seen through a unified schema expressed in an object-oriented data model and can be queried and manipulated using an object-oriented dialect of SQL, perhaps through an advanced query/browser tool that we are also developing. The Garlic architecture is designed to be extensible to new kinds of data repositories, and access efficiency is addressed via a \"middleware\" query processor that uses database query optimization techniques to exploit the native associative search capabilities of the underlying data repositories.<<ETX>>",

This research has produced a taxonomy of models for space, spatial data types and operators, spatial query languages and processing strategies, as well as spatial indexes and clustering techniques. However, more research is needed to improve support for network and field data, as well as query processing (e.g., cost models, bulk load). Another important need is to apply spatial data management accomplishments to newer applications, such as data warehouses and multimedia information systems. The objective of this paper is to identify recent accomplishments and associated research needs of the near term.",

            "abstract": "We make the case for a sensor network model in which each mote stores sensor data locally, and provides a database query interface to the data. Unlike TinyDB and Cougar, in which a sink node provides a database-like front end for filtering the current sensor values from a data collection network, we propose that each sensor device should run its own database system. We present Antelope, a database management system for resource-constrained sensors. Antelope provides a dynamic database system that enables run-time creation and deletion of databases and indexes. Antelope uses energy-efficient indexing techniques that significantly improve the performance of queries. The energy cost of a query that selects 100 tuples is less than the cost of a single packet transmission. Moving forward, we believe that database techniques will be increasingly important in many emerging applications.",

            "abstract": "Relational database systems have been the dominating technology to manage and analyze large data warehouses. Moreover, the ER model, the standard in database design has a close relationship with the relational model. Recently, there has been a surge of alternative technologies for large scale analytic processing, most of which are not based on the relational model. Out of these proposals, distributed file systems together with MapReduce have become strong competitors to relational database systems to analyze large data sets, exploiting parallel processing. Moreover, there is progress on using MapReduce to evaluate relational queries. With that motivation in mind, this panel will compare pros and cons of each technology for data warehousing and will identify research issues, considering practical aspects like ease of use, programming flexibility and cost; as well as technical aspects like data modeling, storage, hardware, scalability, query processing, fault tolerance and data mining.",

This is a process of acquisition, integration, and analysis of big and heterogeneous data generated by a diversity of sources in urban spaces, such as sensors, devices, vehicles, buildings, and human, to tackle the major issues that cities face, e.g., air pollution, increased energy consumption and traffic congestion. Urban computing connects unobtrusive and ubiquitous sensing technologies, advanced data management and analytics models, and novel visualization methods, to create win-win-win solutions that improve urban environment, human life quality, and city operation systems. Urban computing also helps us understand the nature of urban phenomena and even predict the future of cities. Urban computing is an interdisciplinary field fusing the computing science with traditional fields, like transportation, civil engineering, economy, ecology, and sociology, in the context of urban spaces.",

            "title": "Context-Aware Sensor Search, Selection and Ranking Model for Internet of Things Middleware",
            "abstract": "As we are moving towards the Internet of Things (IoT), the number of sensors deployed around the world is growing at a rapid pace. Market research has shown a significant growth of sensor deployments over the past decade and has predicted a substantial acceleration of the growth rate in the future. It is also evident that the increasing number of IoT middleware solutions are developed in both research and commercial environments. However, sensor search and selection remain a critical requirement and a challenge. In this paper, we present CASSARAM, a context-aware sensor search, selection, and ranking model for Internet of Things to address the research challenges of selecting sensors when large numbers of sensors with overlapping and sometimes redundant functionality are available. CASSARAM proposes the search and selection of sensors based on user priorities. CASSARAM considers a broad range of characteristics of sensors for search such as reliability, accuracy, battery life just to name a few. Our approach utilises both semantic querying and quantitative reasoning techniques. User priority based weighted Euclidean distance comparison in multidimensional space technique is used to index and rank sensors. Our objectives are to highlight the importance of sensor search in IoT paradigm, identify important characteristics of both sensors and data acquisition processes which help to select sensors, understand how semantic and statistical reasoning can be combined together to address this problem in an efficient manner. We developed a tool called CASSARA to evaluate the proposed model in terms of resource consumption and response time.",

            "abstract": "Due to the flexibility and scalability in cloud computing, cloud computing nowadays plays an important role to handle a large-scale data analysis. For data processing operations, several cloud data managements (CDMs), such as HBase and Cassandra, are developed. Such CDMs usually provide key-value storages, where each key is used to access its corresponding value. Both HBase and Cassandra provide some basic operations (e.g., Get, Scan) to retrieve the values via keys specified by users. The exiting CDMs fully inherit the characteristics of cloud computing (i.e., high scalability and availability). With the aforementioned characteristics of cloud computing, CDMs are widely employed for Web data, especially for search engines. However, with the proliferation of smart phones and location-based services, data with spatial information, referring as spatial data, are dramatically increasing. Consequently, how to formulate keys for spatial data in the existing CDMs is a challenge issue. In this paper, we develop several key formulation schemes. In particular, we propose a novel Key formulation scheme based on R+-tree (abbreviated as KR+-index). With our design for keys of spatial data, the existing CDMs are able to efficiently retrieve spatial data. In light of KR+-tree, two spatial queries, k-NN query and range query, are designed. Moreover, we implement the proposed key formulation schemes on HBase and Cassandra, and import real spatial data for spatial queries. The experimental results demonstrate that KR+-tree outperforms other existing key formulations and MD-HBase.",

            "abstract": "The K-nearest neighbors (KNN) query has been of significant interest in many studies and has become one of the most important spatial queries in mobile sensor networks. Applications of KNN queries may include vehicle navigation, wildlife social discovery, and squad/platoon searching on the battlefields. Current approaches to KNN search in mobile sensor networks require a certain kind of indexing support. This index could be either a centralized spatial index or an in-network data structure that is distributed over the sensor nodes. Creation and maintenance of these index structures, to reflect the network dynamics due to sensor node mobility, may result in long query response time and low battery efficiency, thus limiting their practical use. In this paper, we propose a maintenance-free itinerary-based approach called density-aware itinerary KNN query processing (DIKNN). The DIKNN divides the search area into multiple cone-shape areas centered at the query point. It then performs a query dissemination and response collection itinerary in each of the cone-shape areas in parallel. The design of the DIKNN scheme takes into account several challenging issues such as the trade-off between degree of parallelism and network interference on query response time, and the dynamic adjustment of the search radius (in terms of number of hops) according to spatial irregularity or mobility of sensor nodes. To optimize the performance of DIKNN, a detailed analytical model is derived that automatically determines the most suitable degree of parallelism under various network conditions. This model is validated by extensive simulations. The simulation results show that DIKNN yields substantially better performance and scalability over previous work, both as kappa increases and as the sensor node mobility increases. It outperforms the second runner with up to a 50 percent saving in energy consumption and up to a 40 percent reduction in query response time, while rendering the same level of query result accuracy.",

            "abstract": "There are two preference-based queries commonly used in database systems: (1) top-k query and (2) skyline query. By combining the ranking rule used in top-\\(k\\) query and the notion of dominance relationships utilized in the skyline query, a top-\\(k\\) dominating query emerges, providing a new perspective on data processing. This query returns the \\(k\\) records with the highest domination scores from the dataset. However, the processing of the top-\\(k\\) dominating query is complex when the dataset operates under a streaming model. With new data being continuously generated while stale data being removed from the database, a continuous top-\\(k\\) dominating query (cTKDQ) requires that updated results can be returned to users at any time. This work explores the cTKDQ problem and proposes a unique indexing structure, called a Close Dominance Graph (CDG), to support the processing of a cTKDQ. The CDG provides comprehensive information regarding the dominance relationship between records, which is vital in answering a cTKDQ with a limited search space. The update process for a cTKDQ is then converted to a simple update affecting a small portion of the CDG. Experimental results show that this scheme is able to offer much better performance when compared with existing solutions.",

            "abstract": "Recent innovations in RFID technology are enabling large-scale cost-effective deployments in retail, healthcare, pharmaceuticals and supply chain management. The advent of mobile or handheld readers adds significant new challenges to RFID stream processing due to the inherent reader mobility, increased noise, and incomplete data. In this paper, we address the problem of translating noisy, incomplete raw streams from mobile RFID readers into clean, precise event streams with location information. Specifically we propose a probabilistic model to capture the mobility of the reader, object dynamics, and noisy readings. Our model can self-calibrate by automatically estimating key parameters from observed data. Based on this model, we employ a sampling-based technique called particle filtering to infer clean, precise information about object locations from raw streams from mobile RFID readers. Since inference based on standard particle filtering is neither scalable nor efficient in our settings, we propose three enhancements---particle factorization, spatial indexing, and belief compression---for scalable inference over large numbers of objects and high-volume streams. Our experiments show that our approach can offer 49\\% error reduction over a state-of-the-art data cleaning approach such as SMURF while also being scalable and efficient.",

            "abstract": "Sparql (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) is a query language and data acquisition protocol designed for RDF development. Although it is defined for the RDF data model developed by the W3C, it can be used in any form of RDF to represent data resources. With the explosive growth of web information resources, more and more data is using RDF structure. The research and obtaining of useful information in massive data has become a major challenge. Efficient search and effective query has become the focus attention of research. In this paper, we design an efficient optimization method by finding a semantic connection chain in the system (SparkIlink). Data was stored on the file system of hadoop (HDFS). Based on Spark framework with efficient distributed memory, this system has achieved efficient searching and optimizing performance for massive RDF data. Our work includes the following mechanism: (1) using vertical partition as data storage structure; (2) using twice data statistics; (3) using information connection chain based on semantic. Our system can support massive triples query in distributed environment to achieve efficient query processing. The experiment of this paper is based on the latest SPARQLGX on the spark platform RDF system. In contrast, our system is more efficient in data search than SPARQLGX.",

            "abstract": "The Mariposa distributed data manager uses an economic model for managing the allocation of both storage objects and queries to servers. We present extensions to the economic model which support replica management, as well as our mechanisms for propagating updates among replicas. We show how our replica control mechanism can be used to provide consistent, although potentially stale, views of data across many machines without expensive per-transaction synchronization. We present a rule-based conflict resolution mechanism, which can be used to enhance traditional time-stamp serialization. We discuss the effects of our replica system on query processing for both read-only and read-write queries. We further demonstrate how the replication model and mechanisms naturally support name service in Mariposa.",

            "abstract": "The growing number and size of clinical medical records (CMRs) represents new opportunities for finding meaningful patterns and patient treatment pathways while at the same time presenting a huge challenge for clinicians. Indeed, CMR repositories share many characteristics of the classical `big data' problem, requiring specialised expertise for data management, extraction, and modelling. In order to help clinicians make better use of their time to process data, they will need more adequate data processing and analytical tools, beyond the capabilities offered by existing general purpose database management systems or database servers. One modelling technique that can readily benefit from the availability of big data, yet remains relatively unexplored is personalised analytics where a model is built for each patient. In this paper, we present a strategy for designing a secure healthcare platform for personalised analytics by focusing on three aspects: (1) data representation, (2) data privacy and security, and (3) personalised analytics enabled by machine learning algorithms.",

            "abstract": "The successful execution of location-based and feature-based queries on spatial databases requires the construction of spatial indexes on the spatial attributes. This is not simple when the data is unstructured as is the case when the data is a collection of documents such as news articles, which is the domain of discourse, where the spatial attribute consists of text that can be (but is not required to be) interpreted as the names of locations. In other words, spatial data is specified using text (known as a toponym) instead of geometry, which means that there is some ambiguity involved. The process of identifying and disambiguating references to geographic locations is known as geotagging and involves using a combination of internal document structure and external knowledge, including a document-independent model of the audience's vocabulary of geographic locations, termed its spatial lexicon. In contrast to previous work, a new spatial lexicon model is presented that distinguishes between a global lexicon of locations known to all audiences, and an audience-specific local lexicon. Generic methods for inferring audiences' local lexicons are described. Evaluations of this inference method and the overall geotagging procedure indicate that establishing local lexicons cannot be overlooked, especially given the increasing prevalence of highly local data sources on the Internet, and will enable the construction of more accurate spatial indexes.",

            "abstract": "Spatial database outsourcing to the cloud allows data owners to take advantage of its cost-effective model with features such as scalability and high computing power. To protect the privacy of outsourced data, cloud service providers should not be able to view or use the data. This paper proposes DISC, a retrieval scheme to answer range queries over databases on the Cloud Service Provider. DISC protects the confidentiality and supports dynamic updates on the outsourced data. To be able to support queries and updates on the Cloud Service Provider, the database index is encrypted using Order-Preserving Encryption. This way, DISC achieves a balance between efficient query execution and data confidentiality in a cloud environment. The security analysis section studies the confidentiality provided by DISC. The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed scheme has a lower communication cost in comparison to existing cloud retrieval schemes.",

            "title": "Learning from Data Streams",
            "abstract": "In the last two decades, machine learning research and practice has focused on batch learning usually with small datasets. In batch learning, the whole training data is available to the algorithm that outputs a decision model after processing the data eventually (or most of the times) multiple times. The rationale behind this practice is that examples are generated at random accordingly to some stationary probability distribution. Also, most learners use a greedy, hill-climbing search in the space of models. What distinguishes current data sets from earlier ones are the continuous flow of data and the automatic data feeds. We do not just have people who are entering information into a computer. Instead, we have computers entering data into each other. Nowadays there are applications in which the data is modelled best not as persistent tables but rather as transient data streams. In some applications it is not feasible to load the arriving data into a traditional DataBase Management Systems (DBMS), and traditional DBMS are not designed to directly support the continuous queries required in these application (Babcock et al., 2002). These sources of data are called Data Streams. There is a fundamental difference between learning from small datasets and large datasets. As pointed-out by some researchers (Brain & Webb, 2002), current learning algorithms emphasize variance reduction. However, learning from large datasets may be more effective when using algorithms that place greater emphasis on bias management. Algorithms that process data streams deliver approximate solutions, providing a fast answer using few memory resources. They relax the requirement of an exact answer to an approximate answer within a small error range with high probability. In general, as the range of the error decreases the space of computational resources goes up. In some applications, mostly database oriented, an approximate answer should be within an admissible error margin. Some results on tail inequalities provided by statistics are useful to accomplish this goal.",

            "abstract": "The use of relational database management systems (RDBMSs) to store and query XML data has attracted considerable interest with a view to leveraging their powerful and reliable data management services. Due to the mismatch between the relational and XML data models, it is necessary to first shred and load the XML data into relational tables, and then btranslate XML queries over the original data into equivalent SQL queries over the mapped tables. Although there is a rich literature on XML-relational storage, none of the existing solutions addresses all the storage problems in a single framework. Works on mapping strategies often have little or no details about query translation, and proposals for query translation often target a specific mapping strategy. XML-storage solutions provided by RDBMS also have limitations. Notably, they are tied to a specific backend and use proprietary mapping languages, which not only may require a steep learning curve, but often are unable to express certain desirable mappings.\n In order to address these limitations, we developed ShreX, a XML-to-relational mapping framework and system that provides the first comprehensive and end-to-end solution to the relational storage of XML data. Mappings in ShreX are defined through annotations to an XML Schema. The use of XML Schema simplifies the mapping process, since it does not require users to master a new specialized mapping language. The use of annotations allows mapping choices to be combined in many different ways. As a result, ShreX not only supports all the mapping strategies proposed in the literature, but also new useful strategies that had not been considered previously. ShreX provides generic (and automatic) document shredding and query translation capabilities; and it is portable --- its mapping specifications are independent of the database backend.",
