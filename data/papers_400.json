            "abstract": "The increase in GPS-enabled devices and proliferation of location-based applications have resulted in an abundance of geotagged (spatial) data. As a consequence, numerous applications have emerged that utilize the spatial data to provide different types of location-based services. However, the huge amount of available spatial data presents a challenge to the efficiency of these location-based services. Although the advent of big data frameworks like Apache Spark has enabled the processing of large amounts of data efficiently, they are designed for general (non-spatial) data. That is due to the build-in data partitioning mechanism that does not take into account the spatial proximity of the data. Therefore, these big data frameworks cannot be readily used for spatial analytics such as efficiently answering spatial queries. To fill this gap, this paper proposes SparkNN, an in-memory partitioning and indexing system for answering spatial queries, such as K-nearest neighbor, on big spatial data. SparkNN is implemented on top of Apache Spark and consists of three layers to facilitate efficient spatial queries. The first layer is a spatial-aware partitioning layer, which partitions the spatial data into several partitions ensuring that the load of the partitions is balanced and data objects with close proximity are placed in the same, or neighboring, partitions. The second layer is a local indexing layer, which provides a spatial index inside each partition to speed up the data search within the partition. The third layer is a global index, which is placed in the master node of Spark to route spatial queries to the relevant partitions. The efficiency of SparkNN was evaluated by extensive experiments with big spatial datasets. The results show SparkNN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art Spark system when evaluated on the same set of queries.",

In contemporary data management environments, data curation infrastructures have a key role in addressing the common challenges found across many different data production and consumption environments. Recent changes in the scale of the data landscape bring major changes and new demands to data curation processes and technologies. This chapter investigates how the emerging big data landscape is defining new requirements for data curation infrastructures and how curation infrastructures are evolving to meet these challenges. Different dimensions of scaling-up data curation for big data are described, including emerging technologies, economic models, incentive models, social aspects, and supporting standards. This analysis is grounded by literature research, interviews with domain experts, surveys, and case studies and provides an overview of the state-of-the-art, future requirements and emerging trends in the field.",

            "abstract": "The extract, transform, and load (ETL) process is at the core of data warehousing architectures. As such, the success of data warehouse (DW) projects is essentially based on the proper modeling of the ETL process. As there is no standard model for the representation and design of this process, several researchers have made efforts to propose modeling methods based on different formalisms, such as unified modeling language (UML), ontology, model-driven architecture (MDA), model-driven development (MDD), and graphical flow, which includes business process model notation (BPMN), colored Petri nets (CPN), Yet Another Workflow Language (YAWL), CommonCube, entity modeling diagram (EMD), and so on. With the emergence of Big Data, despite the multitude of relevant approaches proposed for modeling the ETL process in classical environments, part of the community has been motivated to provide new data warehousing methods that support Big Data specifications. In this paper, we present a summary of relevant works related to the modeling of data warehousing approaches, from classical ETL processes to ELT design approaches. A systematic literature review is conducted and a detailed set of comparison criteria are defined in order to allow the reader to better understand the evolution of these processes. Our study paints a complete picture of ETL modeling approaches, from their advent to the era of Big Data, while comparing their main characteristics. This study allows for the identification of the main challenges and issues related to the design of Big Data warehousing systems, mainly involving the lack of a generic design model for data collection, storage, processing, querying, and analysis.",

There have been efforts to map RDF data to a relational representation, and a number of systems exist that follow this approach. We have been investigating an alternative approach of maintaining the native graph model to represent RDF data, and utilizing graph database techniques (such as a structure-aware index and a graph matching algorithm) to address RDF data management. Since 2009, we have been developing a set of graph-based RDF data management systems that follow this approach: gStore, gStore-D and gAnswer. The first two are designed to support efficient SPARQL query evaluation in a centralized and distributed/parallel environments, respectively, while the last one aims to provide an easy-to-use interface (natural language question/answering) for users to access a RDF repository. In this paper, we give an overview of these systems and also discuss our design philosophy.",

            "abstract": "Public sector organizations (city authorities) have begun to explore ways to exploit big data to provide smarter solutions for cities. The way organizations learn to use new forms of technology has been widely researched. However, many public sector organisations have found themselves in new territory in trying to deploy and integrate this new form of technology (big data) to another fast moving and relatively new concept (smart city). This paper is a cross-sectional scoping study\u2014from two UK smart city initiatives\u2014on the learning processes experienced by elite (top management) stakeholders in the advent and adoption of these two novel concepts. The findings are an experiential narrative account on learning to exploit big data to address issues by developing solutions through smart city initiatives. The findings revealed a set of moves in relation to the exploration and exploitation of big data through smart city initiatives: (a) knowledge finding; (b) knowledge reframing; (c) inter-organization collaborations and (d) ex-post evaluations. Even though this is a time-sensitive scoping study it gives an account on a current state-of-play on the use of big data in public sector organizations for creating smarter cities. This study has implications for practitioners in the smart city domain and contributes to academia by operationalizing and adapting Crossan et al\u2019s (Acad Manag Rev 24(3): 522\u2013537, 1999) 4I model on organizational learning.",

            "abstract": "Efficiently storing and querying XML has been widely studied in research and industrial settings. Major RDBMS vendors now support XML as a native datatype in their systems and provide physical means of storing schema agnostic XML data. Typically this data is stored in CLOBs, BLOBs, or tree forms, with path or value indices used to efficiently process XQuery and SQL queries. However, in many use case queries derived from industrial XML applications, we find that it is very common to query XML based on a group of related property data and to query on the master-detail relationships using the SQL XMLTable construct. We propose an indexing mechanism called the XMLTable Index which is more efficient than the path and value index approach for this class of queries, and provides a way to efficiently process these queries over any physical XML storage form. The XMLTable Index complements the path/value index approach, and can be enhanced in its capabilities by using it in conjunction with path, value, text and other domain indices.",

            "abstract": "The recent explosion in the amount of spatial data calls for specialized systems to handle big spatial data. In this paper, we discuss the main features and components that needs to be supported in a system to handle big spatial data efficiently. We review the recent work in the area of big spatial data according to these four components, namely, language, indexing, query processing, and visualization. We describe each component, in details, and give examples of how it is implemented in existing work. After that, we describe a few case studies of systems for big spatial data and show how they support these four components. This assists researchers in understanding the different design approaches and highlights the open research problems in this area. Finally, we give examples of real applications that make use of these systems to handle big spatial data.",

            "abstract": "We are constantly being told that we live in the Information Era - the Age of BIG data. It is clearly apparent that organizations need to employ data-driven decision making to gain competitive advantage. Processing, integrating and interacting with more data should make it better data, providing both more panoramic and more granular views to aid strategic decision making. This is made possible via Big Data exploiting affordable and usable Computational and Storage Resources. Many offerings are based on the Map-Reduce and Hadoop paradigms and most focus solely on the analytical side. Nonetheless, in many respects it remains unclear what Big Data actually is, current offerings appear as isolated silos that are difficult to integrate and/or make it difficult to better utilize existing data and systems. Paper addresses this lacunae by characterising the facets of Big Data and proposing a framework in which Big Data applications can be developed. The framework consists of three Stages and seven Layers to divide Big Data application into modular blocks. The aim is to enable organizations to better manage and architect a very large Big Data application to gain competitive advantage by allowing management to have a better handle on data processing.",

            "abstract": "Companies are increasingly moving their data processing to the cloud, for reasons of cost, scalability, and convenience, among others. However, hosting multiple applications and storage systems on the same cloud introduces resource sharing and heterogeneous data processing challenges due to the variety of resource usage patterns employed, the variety of data types stored, and the variety of query interfaces presented by those systems. Furthermore, real clouds are never perfectly symmetric - there often are differences between individual processors in their capabilities and connectivity. In this paper, we introduce a federation framework to manage such heterogeneous clouds. We then use this framework to discuss several challenges and their potential solutions.",

            "abstract": "The Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) architecture of Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) makes them perfect for parallel processing of big data. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and evaluation of G-Storm, a GPU-enabled parallel system based on Storm, which harnesses the massively parallel computing power of GPUs for high-throughput online stream data processing. G-Storm has the following desirable features: 1) G-Storm is designed to be a general data processing platform as Storm, which can handle various applications and data types. 2) G-Storm exposes GPUs to Storm applications while preserving its easy-to-use programming model. 3) G-Storm achieves high-throughput and low-overhead data processing with GPUs. We implemented G-Storm based on Storm 0.9.2 and tested it using two different applications: continuous query and matrix multiplication. Extensive experimental results show that compared to Storm, G-Storm achieves over 7x improvement on throughput for continuous query, while maintaining reasonable average tuple processing time. It also leads to 2.3x throughput improvement for the matrix multiplication application.",

            "abstract": "The railroad industry is an infrastructure intensive industry that relies on significant amounts of information and data to operate and maintain each railroad. Using the US railroad industry as a model, this data collection encompasses the full range of railroad activities from tracking of goods shipments and car locations to managing train crews to inspecting and maintaining the infrastructure. This paper will look at this last area, inspection and maintaining the infrastructure and in particular the 330,000 km (200,000 miles) of railroad track in active use in the US. Using a broad range of inspection vehicle to collect data and a new generation of maintenance management software systems to analyze and interpret this data, railroads represent an industry that is starting to make extensive use of its \u201cbig data\u201d to optimize its capital infrastructure and safely manage its operations while keeping costs under control. This paper presents examples of collection, storage and use of \u201cbig data\u201d in the railroad engineering environment.",

            "abstract": "Multimodal data has become a crucial element in the realm of big data analytics, driving advancements in data exploration, data mining, and empowering artificial intelligence applications. To support high-quality retrieval for these cutting-edge applications, a robust multimodal data retrieval platform should meet the challenges of transparent data storage, rich hybrid queries, effective feature representation, and high query efficiency. However, among the existing platforms, traditional schema-on-write systems, multi-model databases, vector databases, and data lakes, which are the primary options for multimodal data retrieval, make it difficult to fulfill these challenges simultaneously. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a more versatile multimodal data retrieval platform to address these issues. In this paper, we introduce a Multimodal Data Retrieval Platform with Query-aware Feature Representation and Learned Index based on Data Lake (MQRLD). It leverages the transparent storage capabilities of data lakes, integrates the multimodal open API to provide a unified interface that supports rich hybrid queries, introduces a query-aware multimodal data feature representation strategy to obtain effective features, and offers high-dimensional learned indexes to optimize data query. We conduct a comparative analysis of the query performance of MQRLD against other methods for rich hybrid queries. Our results underscore the superior efficiency of MQRLD in handling multimodal data retrieval tasks, demonstrating its potential to significantly improve retrieval performance in complex environments. We also clarify some potential concerns in the discussion.",

            "abstract": "With the fast development of big data technologies, IT spending on computer clusters is increasing rapidly as well. In order to minimize the cost, architects must plan big data clusters with careful evaluation of various design choices. Current capacity planning methods are mostly trial-and-error or high level estimation based. These approaches, however, are far from efficient, especially with the increasing hardware diversity and software stack complexity. In this paper, we present CSMethod, a novel cluster simulation methodology, to facilitate efficient cluster capacity planning, performance evaluation and optimization, before system provisioning. With our proposed methodology, software stacks are simulated by an abstract yet high fidelity model, Hardware activities derived from software operations are dynamically mapped onto architecture models for processors, memory, storage and networking devices. This hardware/software hybrid methodology allows low overhead, fast and accurate cluster simulation that can be easily carried out on a standard client platform (desktop or laptop). Our experimental results with six popular Hadoop workloads demonstrate that CSMethod can achieve an average error rate of less than six percent, across various software parameters and cluster hardware configurations. We also illustrate the application of the proposed methodology with two real-world use cases: Video-streaming service system planning and Terasort cluster optimization. All our experiments are run on a commodity laptop with execution speeds faster than native executions on a multi-node high-end cluster.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, spatial applications have become more and more important in both scientific research and industry. Spatial query processing is the fundamental functioning component to support spatial applications. However, the state-of-the-art techniques of spatial query processing are facing significant challenges as the data expand and user accesses increase. In this paper we propose and implement a novel scheme (named VegaGiStore) to provide efficient spatial query processing over big spatial data and numerous concurrent user queries. Firstly, a geography-aware approach is proposed to organize spatial data in terms of geographic proximity, and this approach can achieve high aggregate I/O throughput. Secondly, in order to improve data retrieval efficiency, we design a two-tier distributed spatial index for efficient pruning of the search space. Thirdly, we propose an \"indexing + MapReduce'' data processing architecture to improve the computation capability of spatial query. Performance evaluations of the real-deployed VegaGiStore system confirm its effectiveness.",

            "abstract": "Effective Big Data applications dynamically handle the retrieval of decisioned results based on stored large datasets efficiently. One effective method of requesting decisioned results, or querying, large datasets is the use of SQL and database management systems such as MySQL. But a problem with using relational databases to store huge datasets is the decisioned result retrieval time, which is often slow largely due to poorly written queries / decision requests. This work presents a model to re-architect Big Data applications in order to efficiently present decisioned results: lowering the volume of data being handled by the application itself, and significantly decreasing response wait times while allowing the flexibility and permanence of a standard relational SQL database, supplying optimal user satisfaction in today's Data Analytics world. In this paper we review a Big Data case study in the telecommunications field and use it to experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

            "abstract": "AS an overwhelming amount of data is generated at a faster rate every day from all sources, and applications such as cloud services, the Internet of Things (IoT), social network services and intelligent terminals, it has become more urgent than ever to design, deploy and provision services more wisely so that the provisioned services could support effective acquisition, storage, transformation, process, management and utilization of such data [1], [2], [3]. Manipulating and getting the most out of the Big Data can bring unprecedented value and new opportunities that are critical to business success. Services should be ideally provisioned in a way that speeds up data processing, scales up with data volume, and improves the adaptability and extensibility over data diversity and uncertainties, and finally turns low-level data into actionable knowledge towards better understanding and manipulation of the Big Data. Datacentric big service is an inevitable evolution of services with the emergence of big data in the last decade [4]. Big Data requires services across various domains, heterogeneous networks and cyber-physical worlds to be aggregated, interoperated, and linked together into a massive and complicated collaborative service ecosystem which could in turn handles the challenging issues of Big Data. On the other hand, Big Service is a massive, complicated series of services dealing with Big Data, which can be considered as a correlative and complicated business in the networked virtual and real worlds. It is formed by complicated business services and Web services across multi-domains and multi-networks through convergence or composition of services [4]. This special section aims at presenting the latest developments, trends, and research solutions of service provisioning in the Big Data era. There were 24 submissions and five papers were selected to be included in this special section after several rounds of rigorous review by the guest editors and invited reviewers. The first paper by Lee, Liu, Ganti, Srivatsa, Zhang, Zhou, andWang, \u201cLightweight Indexing andQuerying Services for Big Spatial Data\u201d, considers the challenging issues of effective management of big spatial data. The authors propose lightweight and scalable indexing and querying services for big spatial data that are typically stored in distributed storage systems or graph-based systems. The proposed solutions have several advantages including easy application to existing storage systems, high pruning power, customizable control of index data size, and efficient updates of spatial data. Targeting the similar challenges, the second paper by Song, Schilder, Hertz, Saltini, Smiley, Nivarthi, Hazai, Landau, Zaharkin, Zielund, Molina-Salgado, Brew, and Bennett, \u201cBuilding and Querying an Enterprise Knolwedge Graph\u201d, report a real-world effort from Thomson Reuters on the development of a family of services in building and querying an enterprise knowledge graph. The authors describe their approach on data acquisition, transformation and interlinking. Their approach also features TR Discover, a natural language interface from which users can ask questions using their own words and the questions are then translated into executable queries for answer retrieval. The paper by Li, Zhang, Wu, Liu, Zhu, Yi, Wang, Zhang, andYang, \u201cANovelWorkflow-Level Data Placement Strategy for Data-Sharing Scientific Cloud Workflows\u201d, considers the important topic of data placement in scientific workflow systems and proposes a novel workflow-level data placement model and a two-stage data placement strategy. The paper by Liang, Chen, Wu, Xu, and Wu, \u201cSMS: A Framework for Service Discovery by Incorporating Social Media Information\u201d, focuses on service discovery and presents a framework called SMS for effective discovery of services by incorporating social media information. Finally, the paper by Wang, Wang, Yu, and Zheng, \u201cLearning the Evolution Regularities for BigService-Oriented Online Reliability Prediction\u201d, considers the challenging issues on service reliability and proposes amotifsbased Dynamic Bayesian Networks that can achieve one-stepahead online reliability time series prediction. The authors also propose a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-based prediction approach to deal with big data challenges. These selected papers cover important topics and present some of the key directions in this vibrant and rapidly expanding area of research and development. We hope that the set of selected papers provides the community with a better understanding of the current directions and areas to focus in future, and inspires your own work.",

            "abstract": "The current generation of space-borne sensors are generating nearly continuous streams of massive earth observation datasets. These huge multi-modal streams increase at astonishing rates, reaching currently several petabytes in many satellite archives. Shortly, high-resolution multispectral images will be available almost once a week and in some regions twice per week. However, it is estimated that most of datasets in existing archives have never been accessed and processed outside high-end supercomputing and data-center environments. To this end, a scalable geospatial platform has been designed, developed and evaluated for the online and real-time harvesting of valuable information from big earth observation data. The core of our platform consists of the Rasdaman Array Database Management System for big raster data storage, and the Open Geospatial Consortium Web Coverage Processing Service for data querying. The WebGIS client is based on the OpenLayers and GeoExt JavaScript libraries, while advanced remote sensing and computer vision libraries like GDAL, Oreo Toolbox and OpenCV have been integrated as well. Currently, the system is fully covering Greece with LANDSAT 8 multispectral data, from the beginning of the satellite's mission. Datasets are stored and pre-processed automatically in our hardware. The developed system has been validated for the efficient and automated processing of high resolution satellite data and in particular for key geospatial, environmental, agriculture and water engineering applications like precision agriculture, water quality monitoring and land cover mapping.",

            "abstract": "One of the most promising areas where Big Data Analytics can be integrated into business-oriented projects-allowing research and development teams to work hand in hand with industry representatives - is the digitalization of manufacturing industry. There are two main driving forces for the interest in this area: the promotion of key strategies such as German Government's Industrie 4.0 or General Electric's Industrial Internet, and the use of servitization strategies to transform manufacturing business models. This paper presents a case study based on a Big Data Analytics applied research project developed for a capital equipment manufacturer. Their current business model is based on selling machinery and storage infrastructure for larger chemical manufacturing companies spread worldwide. The project is developed in the context of a servitization strategy where this capital equipment manufacturer aims at attaching valued-added services to their products, leveraging the use of Big Data Analytics to assist their customers in order to optimize their production process. The paper uses the CRISP-DM (CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology as a framework to organize and present our main findings related to the Business Understanding phase. This allow us to provide pragmatic, business-oriented considerations that can be leveraged by research and development teams when exploring opportunities to develop Big Data Analytics projects in the context of manufacturing servitization. Thus, they can face the initial steps of those projects with a better understanding of the specificities of this application field, as well as an a priori identification of problematic situations that may arise and required competencies to be covered by their team members.",

            "abstract": "The HPC and Big Data technologies are two important modern means of the scientific discovery process, but until recently, their development was evolved along two independent paths. Born and matured prior to the Big Data era, HPC scientific-oriented applications were implemented with the Message Passing Interface (MPI) protocol. MPI, however, was not designed for data-intensive applications and therefore requires project-specific extensions. An efficient processing framework offered by the Spark computational platform resolved many issues and built a strong foundation for their subsequent integration. At this time, the Spark ecosystem encompasses a rich collection of data analysis algorithms covering everything from SQL queries, to machine learning, to graph processing. Therefore, the paper proposes to extend this scope with the HPC applications of light source experimental facilities. Specifically, it focuses on the Spark-based integration of the SHARP distributed ptychographic solver developed by the team of the Center for Advanced Mathematics for Research Applications (CAMERA) at Berkeley. Aside from its practical value, this application represents an excellent reference use case that captures the major technical aspects of other beamline applications. The resulting approach is derived from the analysis of alternative communication models implemented in Spark-based distributed deep learning frameworks.",

            "abstract": "In this talk we first present an introduction to AsterixDB [1], a parallel, semistructured platform to ingest, store, index, query, analyze, and publish \"big data\" (http://asterixdb.ics.uci.edu) and the various challenges we addressed while building it. AsterixDB combines ideas from semistructured data management, parallel database systems, and first-generation data-intensive computing platforms (MapReduce and Hadoop). The full AsterixDB software stack provides support for big data applications from the storage and processing engine (Hyracks [2] available at: http://hyracks.googlecode.com), to the exible query optimization layer (Algebricks), to the interfaces for user-level interaction (AQL, HiveQL, Pregelix, etc.) Hyracks is a partitioned-parallel engine for data intensive computing jobs in the form of DAGs. Algebricks is a model-agnostic, algebraic layer for compiling and optimizing parallel queries to be processed by Hyracks. Queries for AsterixDB can be expressed by either popular higher-level data analysis languages like Pig, Hive or Jaql, or by its native query language (AQL) and data model (ADM) with support for semi-structured information and fuzzy data.\n Fundamental data processing operations, like joins and aggregations, are natively supported in AsterixDB. The second part of the talk focuses on our experiences while designing efficient local (per node) aggregation algorithms for AsterixDB. In particular, there are two challenges for local aggregations in a big data system: first, if the aggregation is group-based (like the \"group-by\" in SQL), the aggregation result may not fit in main memory; second, in order to allow multiple operations being processed simultaneously, an aggregation operation should work within a strict memory budget provided by the platform. Despite its importance and challenges, the design and evaluation of local aggregation algorithms has not received the same level of attention that other basic operators, such as joins, have received in the literature. Facing a lack of \"off the shelf\" local aggregation algorithms for big data, we present low-level implementation details for engineering the aggregation operator, utilizing (i) sort-based, (ii) hash-based, and (iii) sort-hash-hybrid approaches. We present six algorithms all of which work within a strictly bounded memory budget, and can easily adapt between in-memory and external processing. Among them, two are novel and four are based on extending existing join algorithms.\n We deployed all algorithms as operators in the Hyracks platform and evaluated their performance through extensive experimentation. Our experiments cover many different performance factors, including input cardinality, memory, data distribution, and hash table structure. Our study guided our selection of the local aggregation algorithms supported in the recent release of AsterixDB, namely: the hybrid-hash. Pre-Partitioning algorithm for its tolerance on the estimation of the input grouping key cardinality, the Hash-Sort algorithm for its good performance when aggregating skewed data, and the Sort-Based algorithm when the input data is already sorted. This local aggregation work is the first part of a two-part big data aggregation study, as it addresses the \"map\" phase. Our findings provide the foundation for the global aggregation strategy we are currently investigating for the \"reduce\" phase. We hope our experience can help developers of other Big Data platforms to build a solid local aggregation operator.",

            "abstract": "MapReduce is a framework for processing and managing large-scale datasets in a distributed cluster, which has been used for applications such as generating search indexes, document clustering, access log analysis, and various other forms of data analytics. MapReduce adopts a flexible computation model with a simple interface consisting of map and reduce functions whose implementations can be customized by application developers. Since its introduction, a substantial amount of research effort has been directed toward making it more usable and efficient for supporting database-centric operations. In this article, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of a wide range of proposals and systems that focusing fundamentally on the support of distributed data management and processing using the MapReduce framework.",

            "abstract": "Big data analytics is the hottest new practice in Business Analytics today. However, recent industrial surveys find that big data analytics may fail to meet business expectations because of lack of business context and lack of expertise to connect the dots, inaccurate scope and batch-oriented Hadoop system. In this paper, we present IRIS - a goal-oriented big data analytics framework using Spark for better business decisions, which consists of a conceptual model which connects a business side and a big data side providing context information around the data, a claim-based evaluation method which enables to focus the most effective solutions, a process on how to use IRIS framework and an assistant tool using Spark which is a real-time big data analytics platform. In this framework, problems against business goals of the current process and solutions for the future process are explicitly hypothesized in the conceptual model and validated on real big data using big queries or big data analytics. As an empirical study, a shipment decision process is used to show how IRIS can support better business decisions in terms of comprehensive understanding both on business and data analytics, high priority and fast decisions.",

            "abstract": "Memory is a crucial resource for big data processing frameworks such as Spark and M3R, where the memory is used both for computation and for caching intermediate storage data. Consequently, optimizing memory is the key to extracting high performance. The extant approach is to statically split the memory for computation and caching based on workload profiling. This approach is unable to capture the varying workload characteristics and dynamic memory demands. Another factor that affects caching efficiency is the choice of data placement and eviction policy. The extant LRU policy is oblivious of task scheduling information from the analytic frameworks, and thus can lead to lost optimization opportunities. In this paper, we address the above issues by designing MEMTUNE, a dynamic memory manager for in-memory data analytics. MEMTUNE dynamically tunes computation/caching memory partitions at runtime based on workload memory demand and in-memory data cache needs. Moreover, if needed, the scheduling information from the analytic framework is leveraged to evict data that will not be needed in the near future. Finally, MEMTUNE also supports task-level data prefetching with a configurable window size to more effectively overlap computation with I/O. Our experiments show that MEMTUNE improves memory utilization, yields an overall performance gain of up to 46%, and achieves cache hit ratio of up to 41% compared to standard Spark.",

However, processing live data alone is often not enough: in many cases, such applications need to combine the live data with previously archived data to increase the quality of the extracted insights. Current streaming-oriented runtimes and middlewares are not flexible enough to deal with this trend, as they address ingestion (collection and pre-processing of data streams) and persistent storage (archival of intermediate results) using separate services. This separation often leads to I/O redundancy (e.g., write data twice to disk or transfer data twice over the network) and interference (e.g., I/O bottlenecks when collecting data streams and writing archival data simultaneously). In this position paper, we argue for a unified ingestion and storage architecture for streaming data that addresses the aforementioned challenge. We identify a set of constraints and benefits for such a unified model, while highlighting the important architectural aspects required to implement it in real life. Based on these aspects, we briefly sketch our plan for future work that develops the position defended in this paper.",

            "abstract": "City-wide GPS recorded taxi trip data contains rich information for traffic and travel analysis to facilitate transportation planning and urban studies. However, traditional data management techniques are largely incapable of processing big taxi trip data at the scale of hundreds of millions. In this study, we aim at utilizing the General Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs) technologies to speed up processing complex spatial queries on big taxi data on inexpensive commodity GPUs. By using the land use types of tax lot polygons as a proxy for trip purposes at the pickup and drop-off locations, we formulate a taxi trip data analysis problem as a large-scale nearest neighbor spatial query problem based on point-to-polygon distance. Experiments on nearly 170 million taxi trips in the New York City (NYC) in 2009 and 735,488 tax lot polygons with 4,698,986 vertices have demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed techniques: the GPU implementations is about 10-20X faster than the host system and completes the spatial query in about a minute by using a low-end workstation equipped with an Nvidia GTX Titan GPU device with a total equipment cost of below $2,000. We further discuss several interesting patterns discovered from the query results which warrant further study. The proposed approach can be an interesting alternative to traditional MapReduce/Hadoop based approaches to processing big data with respect to performance and cost.",

            "title": "Making knowledge discovery services scalable on clouds for big data mining",
            "abstract": "The amount of digital data is increasing beyond any previous estimation and data stores and sources are more and more pervasive and distributed. Professionals and scientists need advanced data analysis tools and services coupled with scalable architectures to support the extraction of useful information from big data repositories. Cloud computing systems offer an effective support for addressing both the computational and data storage needs of big data mining and parallel knowledge discovery applications. In fact, complex data mining tasks involve data- and compute-intensive algorithms that require large and efficient storage facilities together with high performance processors to get results in acceptable times. In this paper we introduce the topic and the main research issues. We discuss how to make knowledge discovery services scalable and present the Data Mining Cloud Framework designed for developing and executing distributed data analytics applications as workflows of services. In this environment we use data sets, analysis tools, data mining algorithms and knowledge models that are implemented as single services that can be combined through a visual programming interface in distributed workflows to be executed on Clouds. The main features of the programming interface are described and performance evaluation of knowledge discovery applications are reported.",

            "abstract": "Remote data integrity checking (RDIC) enables a data storage server, say a cloud server, to prove to a verifier that it is actually storing a data owner\u2019s data honestly. To date, a number of RDIC protocols have been proposed in the literature, but most of the constructions suffer from the issue of a complex key management, that is, they rely on the expensive public key infrastructure (PKI), which might hinder the deployment of RDIC in practice. In this paper, we propose a new construction of identity-based (ID-based) RDIC protocol by making use of key-homomorphic cryptographic primitive to reduce the system complexity and the cost for establishing and managing the public key authentication framework in PKI-based RDIC schemes. We formalize ID-based RDIC and its security model, including security against a malicious cloud server and zero knowledge privacy against a third party verifier. The proposed ID-based RDIC protocol leaks no information of the stored data to the verifier during the RDIC process. The new construction is proven secure against the malicious server in the generic group model and achieves zero knowledge privacy against a verifier. Extensive security analysis and implementation results demonstrate that the proposed protocol is provably secure and practical in the real-world applications.",

            "abstract": "With the advent of Big Data technologies, organizations can efficiently store and analyze more data than ever before. However, extracting maximal value from this data can be challenging for many reasons. For example, datasets are often not stored using human-understandable terms, making it difficult for a large set of users to benefit from them. Further, given that different types of data may be best stored using different technologies, datasets that are closely related may be stored separately with no explicit linkage. Finally, even within individual data stores, there are often inconsistencies in data representations, whether introduced over time or due to different data producers. These challenges are further compounded by frequent additions to the data, including new raw data as well as results produced by large-scale analytics. Thus, even within a single Big Data environment, it is often the case that multiple rich datasets exist without the means to access them in a unified and cohesive way, often leading to lost value. This paper describes the development of a Big Data management infrastructure with semantic technologies at its core to provide a unified data access layer and a consistent approach to analytic execution. Semantic technologies were used to create domain models describing mutually relevant datasets and the relationships between them, with a graphical user interface to transparently query across datasets using domain-model terms. This prototype system was built for GE Power & Water's Power Generation Products Engineering Division, which has produced over 50TB of gas turbine and component prototype test data to date. The system is expected to result in significant savings in productivity and expenditure.",

            "abstract": "Graphs are becoming increasingly dominant in modeling real-life networked data including social and biological networks, the WWW and the Semantic Web, etc. Graph pattern queries are useful for gathering information with expressive semantics from these graph-structured data. Current methods for graph pattern query processing have performance deficiency caused by inefficiencies of the underlying reachability index and costly merge-join operations on huge amounts of tuple-formatted intermediate results. To overcome the above problems, this paper contributes in the following aspects to boost graph pattern query evaluation. First, we propose an improved hop-based reachability indexing scheme 3-Hop which gains faster reachability query evaluation, less indexing costs and better scalabilities than state-of-the-art hop-based methods. Second, we propose a two-stage node filtering algorithm based on 3-Hop to answer tree pattern queries more efficiently. Tree pattern queries serve as the underlying facility for graph pattern query evaluation. Furthermore, we use a graph representation of the intermediate results during node filtering and final results enumeration. Experiments on real-life and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",

This paper addresses the current limitations by developing SDQuery DSI, a GridFTP plug-in that supports flexible server-side data subsetting. An existing GridFTP server is able to dynamically load this tool to support new functionality. Different queries types (query over dimensions, coordinates and values) are supported by our tool. A number of optimizations, like parallel indexing, performance model for data subsetting, and parallel streaming are also applied. We compare our SDQuery DSI with GridFTP default File DSI in different network environments, and show that our method can achieve better efficiency in almost all cases.",

The users that need to perform such data analysis may have several roles, like, business analysts, engineers, end-users etc. Therefore Big Data analytics should be expressed and executed in a manner that is adaptive to the user and the system. We discuss the principles of adaptive analytics and we summarise ongoing work on the creation of a workflow model and, furthermore, a workflow management system that enables the creation and the execution of adaptive analytics. The model focuses on the separation of task dependencies from task functionality and the decoupling of application logic from implementation. Our motivation and applications derive from real use cases of the telecommunication domain.",

            "abstract": "The fact that the United States (U.S.) enjoys a large geographical diversity among states with enormous amount of power consumption makes it challenging to centralize a power management system that can control the power generation and regulate the consumption. Due to lack of centralized control, there is a large imbalance in the ratio of power consumption/power generation from one state to the next. This imbalance results in wasting of large quantities of power generated in states where generation exceeds consumption significantly, whereas other states are suffering from insufficient amount of power generation. Power generation is in direct correlation with the amount of resources used to generate the power. In this paper, we propose a power generation forecasting scheme that could predict the amount of power required at a rate closer to the power consumption. The proposed scheme uses Big Data analytics to process power management data collected in the past 20 years for each state. It then uses a Neural Network (NN) model to train the system for prediction of future power generation based on the collected data. Simulation shows that the proposed scheme can predict power generation close to 99% of the actual usage.",

It provides role hierarchy management and security roles/rules administration by seamlessly integrating the role-based access control RBAC with the object-oriented concept, spatio-temporal constraints, and multimedia standard MPEG-7. As a result, it can deal with challenging and unique security requirements in the multimedia big data environment. First, it supports multilayer access control so different access permission can be conveniently set for various multimedia elements such as visual/audio objects or segments in a multimedia data stream when needed. Second, the spatio-temporal constraints are modeled for access control purpose. Finally, its security processing is efficient to handle high data volume and rapid data arrival rate.",

            "title": "A semantics-aware storage framework for scalable processing of knowledge graphs on Hadoop",
            "abstract": "Knowledge graphs are graph-based data models which employ named nodes and edges to capture differentiation among entities and relationships in richly diverse data collections such as in the biomedical domain. The flexibility of knowledge graphs allows for heterogeneous collections to be linked and integrated in precise ways. However, resulting data models often have irregular structures which are not easy to manage using platforms for structured, schema-first data models like the relational model. To facilitate exchange, inter-operability and reuse of data, standards such as Resource Description Framework (RDF) have been increasingly adopted for representation. Domains such as the biomedical now have large collections of publicly available RDF graphs as well as benchmark workloads. To achieve scalability in data processing, some efforts are being made to build on distributed processing platforms such as Hadoop and Spark. However, while some distributed graph platforms have emerged for certain classes of mining workloads for non-semantic graphs (without typed edges and nodes), knowledge graph processing, which often involves ontological inferencing, continues to be plagued by scalability and efficiency challenges. In this paper, we present the design of a Hadoop-based storage architecture for knowledge graphs that overcomes some of the challenges of big RDF data processing. The rationale of the design strategy is to go beyond the traditional approach of exploiting structural properties of graphs while storing to include exploitation of semantic properties of knowledge graphs. Our system SemStorm is a Hadoop-based indexed, polymorphic, signatured file organization that supports efficient storage of data collections with significant data heterogeneity. Naive storage models for such data place more demands for meta-data management than traditional systems can support. The polymorphic file organization is further coupled with a nested, column-oriented file format to enable discriminatory data access based on queries. A major hallmark of SemStorm is the enabling of semantic-awareness in storage framework. The idea is to exploit the knowledge represented in ontologies that accompany data for optimizing data storage models such as identifying and managing data (sometimes implicit) redundancies. Another major advantage of SemStorm is that it derives optimized storage models for data autonomically, i.e., without user input. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world and synthetic benchmark datasets show that SemStorm is up to 10X faster than existing approaches.",

            "abstract": "Summary Big data are receiving an increasing attention in biomedicine and healthcare. It is therefore important to understand the reason why big data are assuming a crucial role for the biomedical informatics community. The capability of handling big data is becoming an enabler to carry out unprecedented research studies and to implement new models of healthcare delivery. Therefore, it is first necessary to deeply understand the four elements that constitute big data, namely Volume, Variety, Velocity, and Veracity, and their meaning in practice. Then, it is mandatory to understand where big data are present, and where they can be beneficially collected. There are research fields, such as translational bioinformatics, which need to rely on big data technologies to withstand the shock wave of data that is generated every day. Other areas, ranging from epidemiology to clinical care, can benefit from the exploitation of the large amounts of data that are nowadays available, from personal monitoring to primary care. However, building big data-enabled systems carries on relevant implications in terms of reproducibility of research studies and management of privacy and data access; proper actions should be taken to deal with these issues. An interesting consequence of the big data scenario is the availability of new software, methods, and tools, such as map-reduce, cloud computing, and concept drift machine learning algorithms, which will not only contribute to big data research, but may be beneficial in many biomedical informatics applications. The way forward with the big data opportunity will require properly applied engineering principles to design studies and applications, to avoid preconceptions or over-enthusiasms, to fully exploit the available technologies, and to improve data processing and data management regulations.",

            "abstract": "Recent advancements in remote sensing technology have resulted in petabytes of data in raster format. This data is often processed in combination with high resolution vector data that represents, for example, city boundaries. One of the common operations that combine big raster and vector data is the zonal statistics which computes some statistics for each polygon in the vector dataset. This paper proposes a novel distributed system to solve the zonal statistics problem which can scale to petabytes of raster and vector data. The proposed method does not require any preprocessing or indexing which makes it perfect for ad-hoc queries that scientists usually want to run. We devise a theoretical cost model that proves the efficiency o f o ur a lgorithm o ver the baseline method. Furthermore, we run an extensive experimental evaluation on large scale satellite data with up-to a trillion pixels, and big vector data with up-to hundreds of millions of edges, and we show that our method can perfectly scale to big data with up-to two orders of magnitude performance gain over Rasdaman and Google Earth Engine.",

            "abstract": "Technical Support call centres frequently receive several thousand customer queries on a daily basis. Traditionally, such organisations discard data related to customer enquiries within a relatively short period of time due to limited storage capacity. However, in recent years, the value of retaining and analysing this information has become clear, enabling call centres to identify customer patterns, improve first call resolution and maximise daily closure rates. This paper proposes a Proof of Concept (PoC) end to end solution that utilises the Hadoop programming model, extended ecosystem and the Mahout Big Data Analytics library for categorising similar support calls for large technical support data sets. The proposed solution is evaluated on a VMware technical support dataset.",

            "abstract": "The processing of large volumes of RDF data require an efficient storage and query processing engine that can scale well with the volume of data. The initial attempts to address this issue focused on optimizing native RDF stores as well as conventional relational databases management systems. But as the volume of RDF data grew to exponential proportions, the limitations of these systems became apparent and researchers began to focus on using big data analysis tools, most notably Hadoop, to process RDF data. This paper presents a comparative analysis of performance of Presto (distributed SQL query engine) in processing big RDF data against Apache Hive. To evaluate the performance Presto for big RDF data processing, a map-reduce program and a compiler, based on Flex and Bison, were implemented. The map-reduce program loads RDF data into HDFS while the compiler translates SPARQL queries into a subset of SQL that Presto (and Hive) can understand.",

            "abstract": "This paper concerns the fundamental problem of processing conjunctive queries that contain both keyword and range conditions on public clouds in a privacy preserving manner. No prior Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) based privacy preserving conjunctive query processing scheme satisfies the three requirements of adaptive security, efficient query processing, and scalable index size. In this paper, we propose the first privacy preserving conjunctive query processing scheme that satisfies all the above three requirements. To achieve adaptive security, we propose an Indistinguishable Bloom Filter (IBF) data structure for indexing. To achieve efficient query processing and structural indistinguishability, we propose a highly balanced binary tree data structure called Indistinguishable Binary Tree (IBtree). To achieve scalable and compact index size, we propose an IBtree space compression algorithm to remove redundant information in IBFs. To optimize search efficiency, we propose a traversal minimization algorithm. To make our scheme dynamic, we propose update algorithms. We prove that our scheme is adaptive secure under the IND-CKA secure model. The key contribution of this paper is on achieving conjunctive query processing with both strong privacy guarantee and practical efficiency in terms of both speed and space. We implemented our scheme in C++, evaluated and compared its performance with the prior KRB scheme for keyword queries and the prior PBtree scheme for range queries on two real-world data sets. Experimental results show that our scheme is both fast and scalable. For example, processing a query only takes a few milliseconds for millions of records.",

Big data as a popular research topic has brought about a range of new challenges that must to be tackled to support both commercial and research demands. The transport area is one example that has much to benefit from big data capabilities in allowing to process voluminous amounts of data that is created in real time and in vast quantities. Tackling these big data issues requires capabilities not typically found in common Cloud platforms. The high speed of production of data (velocity) of high volume data demands a distributed file system for storing and duplicating data; high performance computing engines capable of processing such large quantities of data in real time; a reliable database system able to optimize the indexing and querying of the data, and essentially a flexible implementation for scaling the usage of computation resources based on the bursty nature of data production. In this paper, we present and benchmark SMASH, a generic and highly scalable Cloud-based solution. We focus here on the implementation and especially on the utilization of the SMASH software stack and how it can be used to process large scale traffic data - although we note that the solution can be applied to other high velocity big data processing areas.",

            "abstract": "Big Data has become the new ubiquitous term used to describe massive collection of datasets that are difficult to process using traditional database and software techniques. Most of this data is inaccessible to users, as we need technology and tools to find, transform, analyze, and visualize data in order to make it consumable for decision-making. One aspect of Big Data research is dealing with the Variety of data that includes various formats such as structured, numeric, unstructured text data, email, video, audio, stock ticker, etc. Managing, merging, and governing a variety of data is the focus of this paper. This paper proposes a semantic Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) framework that uses semantic technologies to integrate and publish data from multiple sources as open linked data. This includes - creation of a semantic data model to provide a basis for integration and understanding of knowledge from multiple sources, creation of a distributed Web of data using Resource Description Framework (RDF) as the graph data model, extraction of useful knowledge and information from the combined data using SPARQL as the semantic query language.",

            "abstract": "Geospatial information has been indispensable for many application fields, including traffic planning, urban planning, and energy management. Geospatial data are mainly stored in relational databases that have been developed over several decades, and most geographic information applications are desktop applications. With the arrival of big data, geospatial information applications are also being modified into, e.g., mobile platforms and Geospatial Web Services, which require changeable data schemas, faster query response times, and more flexible scalability than traditional spatial relational databases currently have. To respond to these new requirements, NoSQL (Not only SQL) databases are now being adopted for geospatial data storage, management, and queries. This paper reviews state-of-the-art geospatial data processing in the 10 most popular NoSQL databases. We summarize the supported geometry objects, main geometry functions, spatial indexes, query languages, and data formats of these 10 NoSQL databases. Moreover, the pros and cons of these NoSQL databases are analyzed in terms of geospatial data processing. A literature review and analysis showed that current document databases may be more suitable for massive geospatial data processing than are other NoSQL databases due to their comprehensive support for geometry objects and data formats and their performance, geospatial functions, index methods, and academic development. However, depending on the application scenarios, graph databases, key-value, and wide column databases have their own advantages.",

            "abstract": "Specifying users' interests with a formal query language is a typically challenging task, which becomes even harder in the context of multi-model data management because we have to deal with data variety. It usually lacks a unified schema to help the users issuing their queries, or has an incomplete schema as data come from disparate sources. Multi-Model DataBases (MMDBs) have emerged as a promising approach for dealing with this task as they are capable of accommodating and querying the multi-model data in a single system. This tutorial aims to offer a comprehensive presentation of a wide range of query languages for MMDBs and to make comparisons of their properties from multiple perspectives. We will discuss the essence of cross-model query processing and provide insights on the research challenges and directions for future work. The tutorial will also offer the participants hands-on experience in applying MMDBs to issue multi-model data queries.",

            "abstract": "Remote sensing data has grown explosively in the past decade. However, remote sensing application systems evolve slowly due to the challenges on big imagery data storage and processing. The cost of accessing current remote sensing images is still very high. The learning curve of using remote sensing images and image processing tools is still steep. The response to emergencies is not fast enough. The development of big data and cloud computing technologies in recent years has brought new opportunities and challenges for remote sensing application. The remote sensing business model based on web and cloud computing environment is a clear trend. This paper gives a brief overview on the challenges faced during building big imagery analytics system for remote sensing, and proposes a cloud computing solution for big imagery data analytics. Experimental results of cloud computing with space, traditional film, and UAV images are also presented in this paper. It is a full stack solution based on ArcGIS platform for remote sensing imagery storage, management, processing and application, which can be an ideal platform for the next generation remote sensing application business model.",

Therefore, we suggest a manufacturing data analysis system that collects event logs from so-called big data and analyzes the collected logs with process mining. There are two kinds of big data generated from manufacturing processes, structured data and unstructured data. Usually, manufacturing process analysis is conducted by using only structured data, however the proposed system uses both structured and unstructured data for enhancing the process analysis results. The system automatically discovers a process model and conducts various performance analysis on the manufacturing processes.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, a comprehensive methodology for designing and querying Parallel Rational Data Warehouses PRDW over database clusters, called Fragmentation & Allocation F&A is proposed. F&A assumes that cluster nodes are heterogeneous in processing power and storage capacity, contrary to traditional design approaches that assume that cluster nodes are instead homogeneous, and fragmentation and allocation phases are performed in a simultaneous manner. In classical approaches, two different cost models are used to perform fragmentation and allocation, separately, whereas F&A makes use of one cost model that considers fragmentation and allocation parameters simultaneously. Therefore, according to the F&A methodology proposed, the allocation phase/decision is done at fragmentation. At the fragmentation phase, F&A uses two well-known algorithms, namely Hill Climbing HC and Genetic Algorithm GA, which the authors adapt to the main PRDW design problem over heterogeneous database clusters, as these algorithms are capable of taking into account the heterogeneous characteristics of the reference application scenario. At the allocation phase, F&A introduces an innovative matrix-based formalism capable of capturing the interactions among fragments, input queries, and cluster node characteristics, driving the data allocation task accordingly, and a related affinity-based algorithm, called F&A-ALLOC. Finally, their proposal is experimentally assessed and validated against the widely-known data warehouse benchmark APB-1 release II.",

            "abstract": "New challenge about the constantly changing of associated data in big data management has arisen, which leads to the issue of data evolution. In this paper, a data evolution model of Virtual Data Space (VDS) is proposed for managing the big data lifecycle. Firstly, the concept of data evolution cycle is defined, and the lifecycle process of big data management is described. Based on these, the data evolution lifecycle is analyzed from the data relationship, the user requirements, and the operation behavior. Secondly, the classification and key concepts about the data evolution process are described in detail. According to this, the data evolution model is constructed by defining the related concepts and analyzing the data association in VDS, for the capture and tracking of dynamic data in the data evolution cycle. Then we discuss the cost problem about data dissemination and change. Finally, as the application case, the service process of dynamic data in the field of materials science is described and analyzed. We verify the validity of data evolution modeling in VDS by the comparison of traditional database, data space, and VDS. It shows that this analysis method is efficient for the data evolution processing, and very suitable for the data-intensive application and the real-time dynamic service.",

            "abstract": "With increasing emphasis on analysis of large-scale scientific data, and with growing dataset sizes, a number of new challenges are arising. Particularly, novel data management solutions are needed, which can work together with the existing tools. This paper examines indexing support for supporting high-level queries (primarily those for sub setting) on array-based scientific datasets. This work is motivated by the limitations arising in visualizing climate datasets (stored in Net CDF), using tools like Para View. We have developed a new indexing strategy, which can help support a variety of sub setting queries over these datasets, including those requiring sub setting over dimensions/coordinates and those involving variable values. Our approach is based on bitmaps, but involves use of two-level indices and careful partitioning, based on query profiles. We also show how our indexing support can be used for sub setting operations executed in parallel. We compare our solutions against a number of other solutions, and demonstrate that our method is more effective.",

            "abstract": "Big Data is a term defining data that has three main characteristics. First, it involves a great volume of data. Second, the data cannot be structured into regular database tables and third, the data is produced with great velocity and must be captured and processed rapidly. Oracle adds a fourth characteristic for this kind of data and that is low value density, meaning that sometimes there is a very big volume of data to process before finding valuable needed information. Big Data is a relatively new term that came from the need of big companies like Yahoo, Google, Facebook to analyze big amounts of unstructured data, but this need could be identified in a number of other big enterprises as well in the research and development field. The framework for processing Big Data consists of a number of software tools that will be presented in the paper, and briefly listed here. There is Hadoop, an open source platform that consists of the Hadoop kernel, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), MapReduce and several related instruments. Two of the main problems that occur when studying Big Data are the storage capacity and the processing power. That is the area where using Grid Technologies can provide help. Grid Computing refers to a special kind of distributed computing. A Grid computing system must contain a Computing Element (CE), and a number of Storage Elements (SE) and Worker Nodes (WN). The CE provides the connection with other GRID networks and uses a Workload Management System to dispatch jobs on the Worker Nodes. The Storage Element is in charge with the storage of the input and the output of the data needed for the job execution. The main purpose of this article is to present a way of processing Big Data using Grid Technologies. For that, the framework for managing Big Data will be presented along with the way to implement it around a grid architecture.",

In this talk we will describe our set of motivating examples and use them to explain the features of SciDB. We then briefly give an overview of the project 'in flight', explaining our novel storage manager, array data model, query language, and extensibility frameworks.",

For better understanding for traffic behaviors, the analyzed data can be provided in a timeline view. In this paper, we formally define a timeline model for traffic data and propose an algorithm for constructing a timeline data structure from raw traffic data. We also suggest traffic analytic query processing algorithms which utilize the timeline information. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm on real traffic datasets from a Busan Intelligent Transport System (ITS) center[1].",

            "abstract": "One response to the proliferation of large datasets has been to develop ingenious ways to throw resources at the problem, using massive fault tolerant storage architectures, parallel and graphical computation models such as MapReduce, Pregel and Giraph. However, not all environments can support this scale of resources, and not all queries need an exact response. This motivates the use of sampling to generate summary datasets that support rapid queries, and prolong the useful life of the data in storage. To be effective, sampling must mediate the tensions between resource constraints, data characteristics, and the required query accuracy. The state-of-the-art in sampling goes far beyond simple uniform selection of elements, to maximize the usefulness of the resulting sample. This tutorial reviews progress in sample design for large datasets, including streaming and graph-structured data. Applications are discussed to sampling network traffic and social networks.",

We introduce a Knowledge Intensive Data-processing System (KIDS) that empowers Big Data applications to support situation awareness. Frameworks such as Apache Hadoop YARN can be leveraged for repeated and near real-time execution of knowledge intensive applications. KIDS bridges the gap between the world of low-value data and the world of high-value information and knowledge, which are best handled by state of the art databases. These databases provide a host of much needed functions such as multi-temporality, flashback, provenance, and registered queries. With KIDS model, Big Data applications are well structured and can evolve perpetually.",

This poses new challenges for data management systems that aim to ingest, store, index, and analyze such data efficiently. In response, we released the first public version of AsterixDB, an open-source Big Data Management System (BDMS), in June of 2013. This paper describes the storage management layer of AsterixDB, providing a detailed description of its ingestion-oriented approach to local storage and a set of initial measurements of its ingestion-related performance characteristics.\n In order to support high frequency insertions, AsterixDB has wholly adopted Log-Structured Merge-trees as the storage technology for all of its index structures. We describe how the AsterixDB software framework enables \"LSM-ification\" (conversion from an in-place update, disk-based data structure to a deferred-update, append-only data structure) of any kind of index structure that supports certain primitive operations, enabling the index to ingest data efficiently. We also describe how AsterixDB ensures the ACID properties for operations involving multiple heterogeneous LSM-based indexes. Lastly, we highlight the challenges related to managing the resources of a system when many LSM indexes are used concurrently and present AsterixDB's initial solution.",

            "abstract": "SPARQL query execution in state of the art RDF engines depends on, and is often limited by the underlying storage and indexing schemes. Typically, these systems exhaustively store permutations of the standard three-column triples table. However, even though RDF can give birth to datasets with loosely defined schemas, it is common for an emerging structure to appear in the data. In this paper, we introduce a novel indexing scheme for RDF data, that takes advantage of the inherent structure of triples. To this end, we define the Extended Characteristic Set (ECS), a schema abstraction that classifies triples based on the properties of their subjects and objects, and we discuss methods and algorithms for the identification and extraction of ECSs. We show how these can be used to assist query processing, and we implement axonDB, an RDF storage and querying engine based on ECS indexing. We perform an experimental evaluation on real world and synthetic datasets and observe that axonDB outperforms the competition by a few orders of magnitude.",

            "abstract": "RDF has become very popular for semantic data publishing due to its flexible and universal graph-like data model. Thus, the ever-increasing size of RDF data collections raises the need for scalable distributed approaches. We endorse the usage of existing infrastructures for Big Data processing like Hadoop for this purpose. Yet, SPARQL query performance is a major challenge as Hadoop is not intentionally designed for RDF processing. Existing approaches often favor certain query pattern shapes while performance drops significantly for other shapes. In this paper, we introduce a novel relational partitioning schema for RDF data called ExtVP that uses a semi-join based preprocessing, akin to the concept of Join Indices in relational databases, to efficiently minimize query input size regardless of its pattern shape and diameter. Our prototype system S2RDF is built on top of Spark and uses SQL to execute SPARQL queries over ExtVP. We demonstrate its superior performance in comparison to state of the art SPARQL-on-Hadoop approaches.",

            "abstract": "In this tutorial, we present the recent work in the database community for handling Big Spatial Data. This topic became very hot due to the recent explosion in the amount of spatial data generated by smartphones, satellites and medical devices, among others. This tutorial goes beyond the use of existing systems as-is (e.g., Hadoop, Spark or Impala), and digs deep into the core components of big systems (e.g., indexing and query processing) to describe how they are designed to handle big spatial data. During this 90-minute tutorial, we review the state-of-the-art work in the area of Big Spatial Data while classifying the existing research efforts according to the implementation approach, underlying architecture, and system components. In addition, we provide case studies of full-fledged systems and applications that handle Big Spatial Data which allows the audience to better comprehend the whole tutorial.",

            "abstract": "The continuous improvement in connectivity, storage and data processing capabilities allow access to a data deluge from sensors, social-media, news, user-generated, government and private data sources. Accordingly, in a modern data-oriented landscape, with the advent of various data capture and management technologies, organizations are rapidly shifting to datafication of their processes. In such an environment, analysts may need to deal with a collection of datasets, from relational to NoSQL, that holds a vast amount of data gathered from various private/open data islands, i.e. Data Lake. Organizing, indexing and querying the growing volume of internal data and metadata, in a data lake, is challenging and requires various skills and experiences to deal with dozens of new databases and indexing technologies: How to store information items? What technology to use for persisting the data? How to deal with the large volume of streaming data? How to trace and persist information about data? What technology to use for indexing the data? How to query the data lake? To address the above mentioned challenges, we present CoreDB - an open source data lake service - which offers researchers and developers a single REST API to organize, index and query their data and metadata. CoreDB manages multiple database technologies and offers a built-in design for security and tracing.",

            "abstract": "In many scientific domains, experimental devices or simulation programs generate large volumes of data. The volumes of data may reach hundreds of terabytes and therefore it is impractical to store them on disk systems. Rather they are stored on robotic tape systems that are managed by some mass storage system (MSS). A major bottleneck in analyzing the simulated/collected data is the retrieval of subsets from the tertiary storage system. We describe the architecture and implementation of a Storage Access Coordination System (STACS) designed to optimize the use of a disk cache, and thus minimize the number of files read from tape. We achieve this by using a specialized index to locate the relevant data on tapes, and by coordinating file caching over multiple queries. We focus on a specific application area, a high energy physics data management and analysis environment. STACS was implemented and is being incorporated in an operational system, scheduled to go online at the end of 1999. We also include the results of various tests that demonstrate the benefits and efficiency gained of using the STACS.",

            "abstract": "Apache Calcite is a foundational software framework that provides query processing, optimization, and query language support to many popular open-source data processing systems such as Apache Hive, Apache Storm, Apache Flink, Druid, and MapD. The goal of this paper is to formally introduce Calcite to the broader research community, brie y present its history, and describe its architecture, features, functionality, and patterns for adoption. Calcite's architecture consists of a modular and extensible query optimizer with hundreds of built-in optimization rules, a query processor capable of processing a variety of query languages, an adapter architecture designed for extensibility, and support for heterogeneous data models and stores (relational, semi-structured, streaming, and geospatial). This exible, embeddable, and extensible architecture is what makes Calcite an attractive choice for adoption in big-data frameworks. It is an active project that continues to introduce support for the new types of data sources, query languages, and approaches to query processing and optimization.",

            "abstract": "In data-intensive real-time applications, e.g., cognitive assistance and mobile health (mHealth), the amount of sensor data is exploding. In these applications, it is desirable to extract value-added information, e.g., mental or physical health conditions, from sensor data streams in real-time rather than overloading users with massive raw data. However, achieving the objective is challenging due to the data volume and complex data analysis tasks with stringent timing constraints. Most existing big data management systems, e.g., Hadoop, are not directly applicable to real-time sensor data analytics, since they are timing agnostic and focus on batch processing of previously stored data that are potentially outdated and subject to I/O overheads. Moreover, embedded sensors and IoT devices lack enough resources to perform sophisticated data analytics. To address the problem, we design a new real-time big data management framework to support periodic in-memory real-time sensor data analytics at the network edge by extending the map-reduce model originated in functional programming, while providing adaptive sensor data transfer to the edge server based on data importance. In this paper, a prototype system is designed and implemented as a proof of concept. In the performance evaluation, it is empirically shown that important sensor data are delivered in a preferred manner and they are analyzed in a timely fashion.",

            "abstract": "The design and implementation of services to handle geospatial data involves thinking about storage engine performance and optimization for the desired use. NoSQL and relational databases bring their own advantages; therefore, it is necessary to choose one of these options according to the requirements of the solution. These requirements can change, or some operations may be performed in a more efficient way on another database engine, so using just one engine means being tied to its features and work model. This paper presents a hybrid approach (NoSQL-SQL) to store geospatial data on MongoDB, which are replicated and mapped on a PostgreSQL database, using an open source tool called ToroDB Stampede; solutions then can take advantage from either NoSQL or SQL features, to satisfy most of the requirements associated to the storage engine performance. A descriptive analysis to explain the workflow of the replication and synchronization in both engines precedes the quantitative analysis by which it was possible to determine that a normal database in PostgreSQL has a shorter response time than to perform the query in PostgreSQL with the hybrid database. In addition, the type of geometry increases the update response time of a materialized view.

Resumen El dise\u00f1o e implementaci\u00f3n de servicios para el manejo de datos geoespaciales implica pensar en el rendimiento del motor de almacenamiento y su optimizaci\u00f3n para cada uso deseado. Las bases de datos relacionales y no relacionales aportan sus propias funcionalidades, por lo tanto, es necesario elegir una de estas opciones de acuerdo con los requisitos de la soluci\u00f3n. Estos requisitos pueden cambiar o tal vez algunas operaciones puedan realizarse de manera m\u00e1s eficiente en otro motor de base de datos, por lo que usar solo un motor significa estar vinculado a sus caracter\u00edsticas y modelo de trabajo. Este art\u00edculo presenta un enfoque h\u00edbrido (NoSQL-SQL) para almacenar datos geoespaciales en MongoDB, estos datos son replicados y mapeados en una base de datos PostgreSQL, utilizando una herramienta de c\u00f3digo abierto llamada ToroDB Stampede; las soluciones pueden aprovechar las funciones NoSQL o SQL para satisfacer la mayor\u00eda de los requisitos asociados con el rendimiento del motor de almacenamiento.

Introduction Finding the proper database for a solution can be vital when talking about performance or any other specific requirement. The set of database engines that support geographic data is limited on both relational and non-relational paradigms, so every key aspect is important when deciding between multiple options: \u201c... the success of geospatial application in any project depends upon Tecnolog\u00eda en Marcha, Vol. 34, N.\u00b0 1, Enero-Marzo 2021 42 the selection, collection, sorting and end-usage of data\u201d [1]. Therefore, the database engine features are an important aspect when deciding which one to use in order to satisfy the data management requirements. In general, NoSQL databases in the non-relational databases paradigm are effective when handling huge amounts of data due to their ability to scale horizontally, the speed of simple operations, the facility to replicate and distribute data between several servers, and the fact of not being tied to a rigid defined structure, which gives them flexibility, among other aspects [2]. In the last years, these databases have been growing with support on geospatial data handling [3], implementing features such as geographic indexing and some usual spatial operations, also increasing compatibility with external geographic tools such as GeoServer. On the other hand, relational databases are efficient when handling large amounts of data that have a fixed structure and guarantee ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) properties in transactions [4]. Some of them also have better geospatial support than most NoSQL engines, providing more complex spatial operations and indexes; they are more easily compatible with other geospatial tools like Mapserver and QGIS [5]. Knowing the main features of both paradigms could help when making a decision to define a storage engine for a specific solution, but the requirements might change as this solution evolves in time, demanding more needs that the current paradigm could not support at his best. Being tied to just relational or non-relational paradigms means that solutions cannot take advantage from the features of the other one, so it would be helpful to achieve a hybrid approach to benefit from both paradigms\u2019 features [4]. A hybrid database model is a database system that uses two or more different database models in a system [6] and functions as an abstraction layer that sits on top of databases, for example in the paradigms SQL and NoSQL [7]. Some benefits in using multiple database models in a system are flexibility [8], increased performance [9, 10, 11], logical distribution [12], their design conceived for the web [6, 13]. Actually, there are some approaches that integrate the SQL and NoSQL paradigms in a hybrid database [6, 9, 14, 15]. However, there are very few papers proposing hybrid databases that work with PostgreSQL and MongoDB. The properties of these databases make them stand out in each of their respective paradigms. PostgreSQL was one of the first databases to address spatial issues [16]. PostgreSQL\u2019s extension, PostGIS [17], is highly optimized for spatial queries [18], and its large quantity of spatial functions make it very relevant. Meanwhile, there are currently over 225 NoSQL databases [19]; in contrast MongoDB, to date, is the only documentbased NoSQL database that supports line intersection and point containment queries [18]. Also, both Database Management Systems (DBMS) are open code, and Geoserver (an open source server for sharing geospatial data) [20] is enabled to give them support, because in its version 2.11.4 this tool includes a data connection and publication component from MongoDB. Another trend in the storage of spatial data is the big data [21, 22, 23, 24]. However, this type of implementation requires very good computing conditions for data storage and processing. In addition, it is necessary to analyze the issue of costs of the different technologies. The intention of this paper is to provide a descriptive analysis of an hybrid (NoSQL/SQL) storage engine\u2019s setting up approach, supported by MongoDB and PostgreSQL engines, to serve as backend for any WebGIS implementation or other desired use. The approach is based on a MongoDB replica set, that is mapped and maintains a live mirror on a PostgreSQL database, with help of a tool called ToroDB Stampede; the restructuring of mapped data in PostgreSQL through materialized views to be used with PostGIS extension. Tecnolog\u00eda en Marcha, Vol. 34, N.\u00b0 1, Enero-Marzo 2021 43 An implementation example is explained in the discussion. In the example, 52 geographic shapes are stored in two different MongoDB databases and replicated on PostgreSQL; the results obtained are 294 tables, 52 materialized views and 294 triggers linked to each table. We also intend to analyze the performance characteristics of the relational side of the proposed environment against other PostgreSQL database with geographic shapes imported from QGIS on Shapefile format, by making a statistic from a set of test samples designed with Apache JMeter tool [25]. There are three test scenarios: the first consist on a performance comparation of both PostgreSQL databases with a \u201cselect *\u201d operation from a multipolygon shape with 21 616 tuples; the second is another comparation with a \u201cselect Points within a Polygon\u201d operation, where the query results in 47 records; the third scenario is to analyze the time taken to refresh the materialized views on the hybrid approach PostgreSQL database. The main results allowed to determine that a normal database in PostgreSQL has a shorter response time than performing the query in PostgreSQL with the hybrid database. The type of geometry also increases the update response time of a materialized view.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we describe a novel analytics system that enables query processing and predictive analytics over streams of aviation data. As part of an Internal Research and Development project, Boeing Research and Technology (BR&T) Advanced Air Traffic Management (AATM) built a system that makes predictions based upon descriptive patterns of archived aviation data. Boeing AATM has been receiving live Aircraft Situation Display to Industry (ASDI) data and archiving it for over two years. At the present time, there is not an easy mechanism to perform analytics on the data. The incoming ASDI data is large, compressed, and requires correlation with other flight data before it can be analyzed.\n The service exposes this data once it has been uncompressed, correlated, and stored in a data warehouse for further analysis using a variety of descriptive, predictive, and possibly prescriptive analytics tools. The service is being built partially in response to requests from Boeing Commercial Aviation (BCA) for analysis of capacity and flow in the US National Airspace System (NAS). The service utilizes a custom tool for correlating the raw ASDI feed, IBM Warehouse with DB2 for data management, WebSphere Message Broker for real-time message brokering, SPSS Modeler for statistical analysis, and Cognos BI for front-end business intelligence (BI) visualization. This paper describes a scalable service architecture, implementation and the value it adds to the aviation domain.",

Motivated by the need to provide an extensible and flexible framework beyond the abstractions provided by API libraries for files to manage and analyze large-scale data, we are developing Damasc, an enhanced file system where rich data management services for scientific computing are provided as a native part of the file system.\n This paper presents our vision for Damasc, a performant file system that would allow scientists or even casual users to pose declarative queries and updates over views of underlying files that are stored in their native bytestream format. In Damasc, a configurable layer is added on top of the file system to expose the contents of files in a logical data model through which views can be defined and used for queries and updates. The logical data model and views are leveraged to optimize access to files through caching and self-organizing indexing. In addition, provenance capture and analysis to file access is also built into Damasc. We describe the salient features of our proposal and discuss how it can benefit the development of scientific code.",

            "abstract": "We observe that the recent advances in big data computing have empowered model-based services such as speech recognition, face recognition, context-aware service, and many other services. Various sources of user's logs can be utilized in remodeling or adapting existing models to improve the quality of service. We propose a system that can support store/retrieve data and process them in a scalable manner. Recently advances in ASR and big data technologies drive more personalized services in many areas of services. A speaker adaptation is one good example which requires huge computation cost in creating a personalized acoustic model and corresponding language model over 100s millions of Samsung product users. We propose a personalized and scalable ASR system powered by the big data infrastructure which brings data-driven personalized opportunities to voice-enabled services such as voice-to-text transcriber, voice-enabled web search in a peta bytes scale. We verify the feasibility of speaker adaptation based on 107 testers' recordings and obtain about 10% of recognition accuracy. We study an optimal set of execution environments by executing jobs running either on Hadoop 1 or Hadoop 2 cluster, and move forward performance optimization strategies: workflow compaction, file compression, best file system selection among several distributed file systems. We devise a metric for the cost of personalized model creation to compare the efficiency of one cluster with the other cluster, and it provides the estimated total execution time for the given number of machines. We finally introduce our in-house object storage and data storage design, and their high performance compared to state-of-the art systems, optimized for voice-enabled services to effectively support small and large files.",

            "abstract": "A large number of continual range queries can be issued against a data stream. Usually, a main memory-based query index with a small storage cost and a fast search time is needed, especially if the stream is rapid. In this paper, we present a CEI-based query index that meets both criteria for efficient processing of continual interval queries in a streaming environment. This new query index is centered around a set of predefined virtual <i>containment-encoded intervals</i>, or CEIs. The CEIs are used to first decompose query intervals and then perform efficient search operations. The CEIs are defined and labeled such that containment relationships among them are encoded in their IDs. The containment encoding makes decomposition and search operations efficient because integer additions and logical shifts can be used to carry out most of the operations. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the CEI-based query index and to compare it with alternative approaches. The results show that the CEI-based query index significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of both storage cost and search time.",
