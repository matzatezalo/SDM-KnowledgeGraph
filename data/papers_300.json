            "title": "Spark SQL: Relational Data Processing in Spark",
            "abstract": "Spark SQL is a new module in Apache Spark that integrates relational processing with Spark's functional programming API. Built on our experience with Shark, Spark SQL lets Spark programmers leverage the benefits of relational processing (e.g. declarative queries and optimized storage), and lets SQL users call complex analytics libraries in Spark (e.g. machine learning). Compared to previous systems, Spark SQL makes two main additions. First, it offers much tighter integration between relational and procedural processing, through a declarative DataFrame API that integrates with procedural Spark code. Second, it includes a highly extensible optimizer, Catalyst, built using features of the Scala programming language, that makes it easy to add composable rules, control code generation, and define extension points. Using Catalyst, we have built a variety of features (e.g. schema inference for JSON, machine learning types, and query federation to external databases) tailored for the complex needs of modern data analysis. We see Spark SQL as an evolution of both SQL-on-Spark and of Spark itself, offering richer APIs and optimizations while keeping the benefits of the Spark programming model.",

            "abstract": "The unprecedented scale at which data is consumed and generated today has shown a large demand for scalable data management and given rise to non-relational, distributed \u201cNoSQL\u201d database systems. Two central problems triggered this process: 1) vast amounts of user-generated content in modern applications and the resulting requests loads and data volumes 2) the desire of the developer community to employ problem-specific data models for storage and querying. To address these needs, various data stores have been developed by both industry and research, arguing that the era of one-size-fits-all database systems is over. The heterogeneity and sheer amount of these systems - now commonly referred to as NoSQL data stores - make it increasingly difficult to select the most appropriate system for a given application. Therefore, these systems are frequently combined in polyglot persistence architectures to leverage each system in its respective sweet spot. This tutorial gives an in-depth survey of the most relevant NoSQL databases to provide comparative classification and highlight open challenges. To this end, we analyze the approach of each system to derive its scalability, availability, consistency, data modeling and querying characteristics. We present how each system's design is governed by a central set of trade-offs over irreconcilable system properties. We then cover recent research results in distributed data management to illustrate that some shortcomings of NoSQL systems could already be solved in practice, whereas other NoSQL data management problems pose interesting and unsolved research challenges.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the field of big data analytics. It has been established that there exist large amounts of data in the energy industry1. However, there is a need to develop methods combining domain knowledge to transform this data into meaningful information to return business intelligence. The existing literature on big data analytics focuses on applications in various fields such as healthcare, aviation industry, finance, energy industry, and supply chain. However, within the energy industry, the application of big data analytics in process safety and risk management is in the nascent stages. The objective of this study is to discuss the potential of big data analytics in the area of process safety and risk management in the energy industry. The paper outlines the systemic framework with different stakeholders, data sources, challenges, and discusses the benefits of big data analytics in process safety. Four case studies with different applications ranging from incident database analysis, predictive modeling for pump failures, dynamic risk mapping of operating plant, and image analysis to gain insights are demonstrated. It is concluded that the application of big data analytics would provide valuable insights for more informed policy, strategic, and operational risk decision-making leading to a safer and more reliable industry.",

            "abstract": "Big Data Analytics and Deep Learning are two high-focus of data science. Big Data has become important as many organizations both public and private have been collecting massive amounts of domain-specific information, which can contain useful information about problems such as national intelligence, cyber security, fraud detection, marketing, and medical informatics. Companies such as Google and Microsoft are analyzing large volumes of data for business analysis and decisions, impacting existing and future technology. Deep Learning algorithms extract high-level, complex abstractions as data representations through a hierarchical learning process. Complex abstractions are learnt at a given level based on relatively simpler abstractions formulated in the preceding level in the hierarchy. A key benefit of Deep Learning is the analysis and learning of massive amounts of unsupervised data, making it a valuable tool for Big Data Analytics where raw data is largely unlabeled and un-categorized. In the present study, we explore how Deep Learning can be utilized for addressing some important problems in Big Data Analytics, including extracting complex patterns from massive volumes of data, semantic indexing, data tagging, fast information retrieval, and simplifying discriminative tasks. We also investigate some aspects of Deep Learning research that need further exploration to incorporate specific challenges introduced by Big Data Analytics, including streaming data, high-dimensional data, scalability of models, and distributed computing. We conclude by presenting insights into relevant future works by posing some questions, including defining data sampling criteria, domain adaptation modeling, defining criteria for obtaining useful data abstractions, improving semantic indexing, semi-supervised learning, and active learning.",

GEOSPARK consists of three main layers: Apache Spark Layer, Spatial RDD Layer and Spatial Query Processing Layer. Apache Spark Layer provides basic Apache Spark functionalities as regular RDD operations. Spatial RDD Layer consists of three novel Spatial Resilient Distributed Datasets (SRDDs) which extend regular Apache Spark RDD to support geometrical and spatial objects with data partitioning and indexing. Spatial Query Processing Layer executes spatial queries (e.g., Spatial Join) on SRDDs. The dynamic status of SRDDs and spatial operations are visualized by GEOSPARK monitoring map interface. We demonstrate GEOSPARK using three spatial analytics applications (spatial aggregation, autocorrelation and co-location) to show how users can easily define their spatial analytics tasks and efficiently process such tasks on large-scale spatial data at interactive performance.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT An adequate compute and storage infrastructure supporting the full exploitation of Copernicus and Earth Observation datasets is currently not available in Europe. This paper presents the cross-disciplinary open-source technologies being leveraged in the C-SCALE project to develop an open federation of compute and data providers as an alternative to monolithic infrastructures for processing and analysing Copernicus and Earth Observation data. Three critical aspects of the federation and the chosen technologies are elaborated upon: (1) federated data discovery, (2) federated access and (3) software distribution. With these technologies the open federation aims to provide homogenous access to resources, thereby enabling its users to generate meaningful results quickly and easily. This will be achieved by abstracting the complexity of infrastructure resource access provisioning and orchestration, including discovery of data across distributed archives, away from the end-users. Which is needed because end-users wish to focus on analysing ready-to-use data products and models rather than spending their time on the setup and maintenance of complex and heterogeneous IT infrastructures. The open federation will support processing and analysing the vast amounts of Copernicus and Earth Observation data that are critical for the implementation of the Destination Earth resp. Digital Twins vision for a high precision digital model of the Earth to model, monitor and simulate natural phenomena and related human activities.",

            "abstract": "MOTIVATION\nImprovement of sequencing technologies and data processing pipelines is rapidly providing sequencing data, with associated high-level features, of many individual genomes in multiple biological and clinical conditions. They allow for data-driven genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic characterizations, but require state-of-the-art 'big data' computing strategies, with abstraction levels beyond available tool capabilities.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe propose a high-level, declarative GenoMetric Query Language (GMQL) and a toolkit for its use. GMQL operates downstream of raw data preprocessing pipelines and supports queries over thousands of heterogeneous datasets and samples; as such it is key to genomic 'big data' analysis. GMQL leverages a simple data model that provides both abstractions of genomic region data and associated experimental, biological and clinical metadata and interoperability between many data formats. Based on Hadoop framework and Apache Pig platform, GMQL ensures high scalability, expressivity, flexibility and simplicity of use, as demonstrated by several biological query examples on ENCODE and TCGA datasets.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION\nThe GMQL toolkit is freely available for non-commercial use at http://www.bioinformatics.deib.polimi.it/GMQL/.",

            "abstract": "The proliferation of data in RDF format has resulted in the emergence of a plethora of specialized management systems. While the ability to adapt to the complexity of a SPARQL query -- given their inherent diversity -- is crucial, current approaches do not scale well when faced with substantially complex, non-selective joins, resulting in exponential growth of execution times. In this demonstration we present H2 RDF+, an RDF store that efficiently performs distributed Merge and Sort-Merge joins using a multiple-index scheme over HBase indexes. Through a greedy planner that incorporates our cost-model, it adaptively commands for either single or multi-machine query execution based on join complexity. In this paper, we present its key scientific contributions and allow participants to interact with an H2RDF+ deployment over a Cloud infrastructure. Using a web-based GUI we allow users to load different datasets (both real and synthetic), apply any query (custom or predefined) and monitor its execution. By allowing real-time inspection of cluster status, response times and committed resources the audience will evaluate the validity of H2RDF+'s claims and perform direct comparisons to two other state-of-the-art RDF stores.",

            "abstract": "Hive has long been one of the industry-leading systems for Data Warehousing in Big Data contexts, mainly organizing data into databases, tables, partitions and buckets, stored on top of an unstructured distributed file system like HDFS. Some studies were conducted for understanding the ways of optimizing the performance of several storage systems for Big Data Warehousing. However, few of them explore the impact of data organization strategies on query performance, when using Hive as the storage technology for implementing Big Data Warehousing systems. Therefore, this paper evaluates the impact of data partitioning and bucketing in Hive-based systems, testing different data organization strategies and verifying the efficiency of those strategies in query performance. The obtained results demonstrate the advantages of implementing Big Data Warehouses based on denormalized models and the potential benefit of using adequate partitioning strategies. Defining the partitions aligned with the attributes that are frequently used in the conditions/filters of the queries can significantly increase the efficiency of the system in terms of response time. In the more intensive workload benchmarked in this paper, overall decreases of about 40% in processing time were verified. The same is not verified with the use of bucketing strategies, which shows potential benefits in very specific scenarios, suggesting a more restricted use of this functionality, namely in the context of bucketing two tables by the join attribute of these tables.",

The ABAC authorization process takes place in two main stages. Firstly a sequence of permissions is derived which specifies permitted data to be retrieved for the user's transaction. Secondly, query modification is used to augment the user's transaction with code which implements the ABAC controls. This requires the storage technologies to support a high-level language such as SQL or similar. The modified user transactions are then optimized and processed using the full functionality of the underlying storage systems. We use an extended ABAC model (TCM2) which handles negative permissions and overrides in a single permissions processing mechanism. We illustrate these concepts using a compelling electronic health records scenario.",

            "abstract": "When the amount of data is very large and it cannot be handled by the conventional database management system, then it is called big data. Big data is creating new challenges for the data analyst. There can be three forms of data, structured form, unstructured form and semi structured form. Most of the part of bigdata is in unstructured form. Unstructured data is difficult to handle. The Apache Hadoop project provides better tools and techniques to handle this huge amount of data. A Hadoop distributed file system for storage and the MapReduce techniques for processing this data can be used. In this paper, we presented our experimental work done on big data using the Hadoop distributed file system and the MapReduce. We have analyzed the variable like amount of time spend by the maps and the reduce, different memory usages by the Mappers and the reducers. We have analyzed these variables for storage and processing of the data on a Hadoop cluster.",

            "abstract": "In a world increasingly connected, and in which information flows quickly and affects a very large number of people, sentiment analysis has seen a spectacular development over the past ten years. This is due to the fact that the explosion of social networks has allowed anyone with internet access to publicly express his opinion. Moreover, the emergence of big data has brought enormous opportunities and powerful storage and analytics tools to the field of sentiment analysis. However, big data introduces new variables and constraints that could radically affect the traditional models of sentiment analysis. Therefore, new concerns, such as big data quality, have to be addressed to get the most out of big data. To the best of our knowledge, no contributions have been published so far which address big data quality in SA throughout its different processes. In this paper, we first highlight the most important big data quality metrics to consider in any big data project. Then, we show how these metrics could be specifically considered in SA approaches and this for each phase in the big data value chain.",

            "abstract": "Advances in Web technology and the proliferation of mobile devices and sensors connected to the Internet have resulted in immense processing and storage requirements. Cloud computing has emerged as a paradigm that promises to meet these requirements. This work focuses on the storage aspect of cloud computing, specifically on data management in cloud environments. Traditional relational databases were designed in a different hardware and software era and are facing challenges in meeting the performance and scale requirements of Big Data. NoSQL and NewSQL data stores present themselves as alternatives that can handle huge volume of data. Because of the large number and diversity of existing NoSQL and NewSQL solutions, it is difficult to comprehend the domain and even more challenging to choose an appropriate solution for a specific task. Therefore, this paper reviews NoSQL and NewSQL solutions with the objective of: (1) providing a perspective in the field, (2) providing guidance to practitioners and researchers to choose the appropriate data store, and (3) identifying challenges and opportunities in the field. Specifically, the most prominent solutions are compared focusing on data models, querying, scaling, and security related capabilities. Features driving the ability to scale read requests and write requests, or scaling data storage are investigated, in particular partitioning, replication, consistency, and concurrency control. Furthermore, use cases and scenarios in which NoSQL and NewSQL data stores have been used are discussed and the suitability of various solutions for different sets of applications is examined. Consequently, this study has identified challenges in the field, including the immense diversity and inconsistency of terminologies, limited documentation, sparse comparison and benchmarking criteria, and nonexistence of standardized query languages.",

            "abstract": "In this work, we develop a prototype about a big data management system for storing, indexing, and searching for huge-scale energy usage data. Rather than existing, commercial relational databases such as Oracle and IBM-DB2, this system is able to provide us with high availability and performance at low cost. It is also able to manage unstructured data and store big data in distributed environment. In addition, using data access APIs, target data is quickly retrieved from our proposed system. To utilize our prototype system, we also propose an energy consumption prediction model based on penalized linear regression-based map/reduce algorithms. Then, we exploit discriminate features with respect to time stamp. Finally, given a time stamp (e.g., 2014-01-05 12:01:08), our proposed learning model will give us a predicted value about the energy usage (e.g., 90 watt) at that time. According to our experimental results obtained from about 7.5 million records, each of which consists of an energy usage and time stamp during three months in 2014, it turns out that our prediction model can predict real values that are very close to actual energy usage at that time, and is about 1.72 times faster than in a single machine.",

            "abstract": "Objectives A number of technologies can reduce overall costs for the prevention or management of chronic illnesses. These include devices that constantly monitor health indicators, devices that auto-administer therapies, or devices that track real-time health data when a patient self-administers a therapy. Because they have increased access to high-speed Internet and smartphones, many patients have started to use mobile applications (apps) to manage various health needs. These devices and mobile apps are now increasingly used and integrated with telemedicine and telehealth via the medical Internet of Things (mIoT). This paper reviews mIoT and big data in healthcare fields. Methods mIoT is a critical piece of the digital transformation of healthcare, as it allows new business models to emerge and enables changes in work processes, productivity improvements, cost containment and enhanced customer experiences. Results Wearables and mobile apps today support fitness, health education, symptom tracking, and collaborative disease management and care coordination. All those platform analytics can raise the relevancy of data interpretations, reducing the amount of time that end users spend piecing together data outputs. Insights gained from big data analysis will drive the digital disruption of the healthcare world, business processes and real-time decision-making. Conclusions A new category of \"personalised preventative health coaches\" (Digital Health Advisors) will emerge. These workers will possess the skills and the ability to interpret and understand health and well-being data. They will help their clients avoid chronic and diet-related illness, improve cognitive function, achieve improved mental health and achieve improved lifestyles overall. As the global population ages, such roles will become increasingly important.",

            "abstract": "While surveillance video is the biggest source of unstructured Big Data today, the emergence of high-efficiency video coding (HEVC) standard is poised to have a huge role in lowering the costs associated with transmission and storage. Among the benefits of HEVC over the legacy MPEG-4 Advanced Video Coding (AVC), is a staggering 40 percent or more bitrate reduction at the same visual quality. Given the bandwidth limitations, video data are compressed essentially by removing spatial and temporal correlations that exist in its uncompressed form. This causes compressed data, which are already de-correlated, to serve as a vital resource for machine learning with significantly fewer samples for training. In this paper, an efficient approach to foreground extraction/segmentation is proposed using novel spatio-temporal de-correlated block features extracted directly from the HEVC compressed video. Most related techniques, in contrast, work on uncompressed images claiming significant storage and computational resources not only for the decoding process prior to initialization but also for the feature selection/extraction and background modeling stage following it. The proposed approach has been qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated against several other state-of-the-art methods.",

To support users in the hard task of deciding which Big Data solution is the most appropriate according to their specific requirements, we propose a generic architecture to classify analytical approaches. We also establish a classification of the existing query languages, based on the facilities provided to access the big data architectures. Moreover, to evaluate different solutions, we propose a set of criteria of comparison, such as OLAP support, scalability, and fault tolerance support. We classify different existing Big Data analytics solutions according to our proposed generic architecture and qualitatively evaluate them in terms of the criteria of comparison. We illustrate how ou r proposed generic architecture can be used to decide which Big Data analytic approach is suitable in the context of several use cases.",

            "abstract": "Purpose \n \n \n \n \nThe purpose of this paper is to provide an insight about factors affecting Big Data Analytics (BDA) utilization and adoption in Indian firms. Research studies have so far focused on BDA adoption in developed economies. This study examines the factors that influence BDA usage and adoption in the context of emerging economies. \n \n \n \n \nDesign/methodology/approach \n \n \n \n \nThis study proposed a theoretical model of factors influencing BDA utilization and adoption. Two independent research streams \u2013 first, the top managers\u2019 perceived strategic value (PSV) in BDA and second, the factors that influence the adoption of BDA theoretically \u2013 have been integrated with the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework. In the BDA context, there was a theoretical necessity to identify the driver and barriers of BDA from the TOE framework on PSV and adoption of BDA. A qualitative exploratory study using face-to-face semi-structured interviews was carried out to collect data from 22 different enterprises and service providers in India. India was selected as the context as it is one of the fastest growing large economies of the world with huge potential of BDA to improve the business landscape. \n \n \n \n \nFindings \n \n \n \n \nThe results showed that the major reason behind BDA non-adoption is that the organizations did not realize the strategic value (SV) of BDA, and they were not ready to make the changes because of technological, organizational and environmental difficulties. The findings corroborate previous results about significant factors affecting IT adoption and implementation and provide new and interesting insights. The main factors identified as playing a significant role in organizations\u2019 adoption of BDA were SV of BDA, complexity, compatibility, IT assets, top management support, organization data environment, perceived costs, external pressure and industry type. \n \n \n \n \nResearch limitations/implications \n \n \n \n \nThe main limitation related to this study is the difficulty in generalizing the findings to a larger population of enterprises. To overcome this, a statistical survey has been planned to be conducted in the future. \n \n \n \n \nPractical implications \n \n \n \n \nThe BDA adoption model in this study will have both managerial implications for practitioners in India, as well as those in other developing countries, and academic implications for researchers who are interested in BDA adoption in developing counties, in terms of formulating better strategies for BDA adoption. For managers, using the research model of this study could assist in increasing their understanding of why some organizations choose to adopt BDA, while similar ones facing similar conditions do not. Also, the understanding of the strategic utilization of BDA in different business processes may improve the adoption of BDA in organizations. \n \n \n \n \nOriginality/value \n \n \n \n \nThis paper contributes in exploring and enhancing the understanding of the factors affecting the utilization and adoption of BDA in organizations from an Indian perspective. This study is an attempt to develop and explore a BDA adoption model by the fusion of PSV and TOE framework. The effect of the three contexts of this framework (technological, organizational and environmental) on the strategic utilization of BDA has been studied for the first time.",

In this paper, we present the design, implementation and evaluation of  G-Storm, a GPU-enabled parallel system based on Storm, which harnesses the massively parallel computing power of GPUs for high-throughput online stream data processing. G-Storm has the following desirable features: 1) G-Storm is designed to be a general data processing platform as Storm, which can handle various applications and data types. 2) G-Storm exposes GPUs to Storm applications while preserving its easy-to-use programming model. 3) G-Storm achieves high-throughput and low-overhead data processing with GPUs. 4) G-Storm accelerates data processing further by enabling Direct Data Transfer (DDT), between two executors that process data at a common GPU. We implemented G-Storm based on Storm 0.9.2 and tested it using three different applications, including continuous query, matrix multiplication and image resizing. Extensive experimental results show that 1) Compared to Storm, G-Storm achieves over 7\u00d7 improvement on throughput for continuous query, while maintaining reasonable average tuple processing time. It also leads to 2.3\u00d7 and 1.3\u00d7 throughput improvements on the other two applications, respectively. 2) DDT significantly reduces data processing time.",

Data grow rapidly, since applications produce continuously increasing volumes of unstructured and structured data. The impact on data processing, transfer, and storage is the need to reevaluate the approaches and solutions to better answer user needs. In this context, scheduling models and algorithms have an important role. A large variety of solutions for specific applications and platforms exist, so a thorough and systematic analysis of existing solutions for scheduling models, methods, and algorithms used in big data processing and storage environments has high importance. This chapter presents the best of existing solutions and creates an overview of current and near-future trends. It will highlight, from a research perspective, the performance and limitations of existing solutions and will offer the scientists from academia and designers from industry an overview of the current situation in the area of scheduling and resource management related to big data processing.",

            "abstract": "Nowadays, a huge amount of data is being continuously generated in all fields of life by all systems and applications on daily basis. This amount of data is increasing at a rapid pace. The collection of this huge amount of data leads to challenges of storage, analysis, etc. Since, processing this huge amount of data is a challenge for learning algorithms of Artificial Intelligence (machine learning), therefore, in this paper, we target the Sampling of data in big data paradigm. We analyze, how and what will be the role of sampling the training data so that machine algorithms are able to rapidly and precisely build a training model from this huge amount of data. The data normally represents some model. Since, it is extremely difficult to learn a pattern or a model from huge data (precisely and quickly). Thus, this paper studies and analyzes the role of sampling in data sets. Though our data sets cover only specific areas, the training data is objectively similar in nature for machine learning algorithms. We concentrate on how sampling will play its role in specific fields of Artificial Intelligence, i.e., training and testing paradigm and in real time as well. From the experimental analysis, we observe that re-sampling the data has a very slight impact on the over-all classification performance. However, it has greater impact of the execution time as seen from experimental results. Finally, we believe the results in this paper should be viewed as indicative for future research rather than conclusive.",

            "abstract": "With the rising growth trend of data size in the Internet era, storage, analysis, and processing of big data arebecomingamong the strongtopics in academia and industry. Typical big data processing platforms adopt the MapReduce programming model to perform application processing. For example, the deployment and calculation method of Hadoop are as follows: Hadoop first collects data and stores them in distributed storage systems, which are storage nodes in clusters. Then, the compute nodes read data from the storage nodes and perform map operations. Lastly, the compute nodes communicate with each other and obtain computation results by performing reduction operations. In the process of collecting and storing data, the storage nodes mainly perform IO operations; hence, the computing resources of these nodes are not fully utilized. This paper proposes a big data preprocessing system based on Hadoop platforms. The main idea of this system is that the data collection and storage phase starts computation operations earlier by utilizing idle computing resources on the basis that IO performance is not affected. This idea can reduce the data size of disk transfer and network communication, and the runtime of applications. Experiments conducted with WordCount, a typical big data processing application, indicate that the system can improve the performance of Hadoop applications.",

In fact, traditional RDMS ensure data integrity and transaction consistency. But, this is at the cost of a rigid storage schema and a complex management. Certainly, data integrity and consistency are required in many cases like in financial applications but they are not always needed. The goal of this paper is to establish a precise picture about NoSQL's evolution and mechanisms as well as the advantages and disadvantages of the main NoSQL data models and frameworks. For this purpose, first, a deep comparison between SQL and NoSQL databases is presented. Many criteria are examined such as: scalability, performance, consistency, security, analytical capabilities and fault-tolerance mechanisms. Second, the four major types of NoSQL databases are defined and compared: key-value stores, document databases, column-oriented databases and graph databases. Third, we compare for each NoSQL data model the main available technical solutions.",

            "abstract": "PurposeBig Data (BD) is being increasingly used in a variety of industries including construction. Yet, little research exists that has examined the factors which drive BD adoption in construction. The purpose of this paper is to address this gap in knowledge.Design/methodology/approachData collected from literature (55 articles) were analyzed using content analysis techniques. Taking a two-pronged approach, first study presents a systematic perspective of literature on BD in construction. Then underpinned by technology\u2013organization\u2013environment theory and supplemented by literature, a conceptual model of five antecedent factors of BD adoption for use in construction is proposed.FindingsThe results show that BD adoption in construction is driven by a number of factors: first, technological: augmented BD\u2013BIM integration and BD relative advantage; second, organizational: improved design and execution efficiencies, and improved project management capabilities; and third, environmental: augmented availability of BD-related technology for construction. Hypothetical relationships involving these factors are then developed and presented through a new model of BD adoption in construction.Research limitations/implicationsThe study proposes a number of adoption factors and then builds a new conceptual model advancing theories on technologies adoption in construction.Practical implicationsFindings will help managers (e.g. chief information officers, IT/IS managers, business and senior managers) to understand the factors that drive adoption of BD in construction and plan their own BD adoption. Results will help policy makers in developing policy guidelines to create sustainable environment for the adoption of BD for enhanced economic, social and environmental benefits.Originality/valueThis paper develops a new model of BD adoption in construction and proposes some new factors of adoption process.",

Moreover, data formats and computational behaviors of scientific big data workloads are much more complex than those in Internet services. These two facts pose a serious challenge to scientific data management and analytics. Among many concerns, the first one is how to build a comprehensive and representative scientific big data benchmark suite. Previous benchmark efforts either focus on Internet areas (i.e. BigDataBench) or pay attention to a specific area (i.e. GeneBase). This paper presents our preliminary work on building a comprehensive scientific big data benchmark suite---BigDataBench-S. Also, we use BigDataBench-S to evaluate several general-purpose big data management systems specifically designed for Internet services applications. Our evaluation shows: these systems cannot achieve expected performance for many scientific workloads, especially for complex matrix computation, for the lack of appropriate mechanisms and policies on data storage, query optimization and support of distributed matrix computation.",

            "abstract": "Advances in deep learning have greatly widened the scope of automatic computer vision algorithms and enable users to ask questions directly about the content in images and video. This paper explores the necessary steps towards a future Visual Data Management System (VDMS), where the predictions of such deep learning models are stored, managed, queried, and indexed. We propose a query and data model that disentangles the neural network models used, the query workload, and the data source semantics from the query processing layer. Our system, DeepLens, is based on dataflow query processing systems and this research prototype presents initial experiments to elicit important open research questions in visual analytics systems. One of our main conclusions is that any future \"declarative\" VDMS will have to revisit query optimization and automated physical design from a unified perspective of performance and accuracy tradeoffs. Physical design and query optimization choices can not only change performance by orders of magnitude, they can potentially affect the accuracy of results.",

The authors also evaluate construction-scheduling control using the earned value management technique and implement an artificial neural network to correlate the results. The authors then develop a quality risk and schedule correlation model based on Big Data. The model can predict the relationship between the planned schedule and the project quality risk using multiple variables such as the number of layers, the schedule performance index and budget costs.\n\n\nFindings\nThe methodology offers an innovative approach for assessment on the relationship between quality risk and project schedule. The authors have also built a multiple regression analysis model for comparative purposes with the model. The results show that the proposed model can better describe the relationship. The model can provide a quantitative quality risk value that changes with the planned schedule, as well as help project managers to understand the relationship between quality risk and project scheduling more accurately.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThe research approach only focuses on quality risk under the impact of scheduling. Future efforts might focus on developing a model that connects failure models with project schedules and costs in order to improve the effort of quality management.\n\n\nPractical implications\nThe model based on Big Data in this paper is developed using real projects and reflects the relationship between project quality risk and scheduling in real environments. The created application provides support for project managers to develop and adjust quality plans and schedules, thereby reducing deviations in quality and scheduling objectives.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe authors make full use of historical project data from the perspective of both quality and schedule management, and provide a novel method to intelligently and objectively analyze the relationship between quality risk and scheduling.\n",

            "abstract": "With the fast development of Web-based solutions, a variety of paradigms and platforms are emerging as value creators or improvers in multiple industries. This trend has also enable financial firms to improve their business processes and create new services. Sharing data between financial service institutions has become an option of achieving value enhancements. However, the concern of the privacy information leakage has also arisen, which impacts on both financial organizations and customers. It is important for stakeholders in financial services to be aware of the proper information classifications, by which determining which information can be shared between the financial service institutions. This paper focuses on this issue and proposes a new approach that use combined supervised learning techniques to classify the information in order to avoid releasing those information that can be harmful for either financial service providers or customers. The proposed model is entitled as Supervised learning-Based Secure Information Classification (SEB-SIC) model, which is mainly supported by the proposed Decision Tree-based Risk Prediction (DTRP) algorithm. The proposed scheme is a predictive mechanism that uses the historical data as the training dataset. The performance of our proposed mechanism has been assessed by the experimental evaluations.",

            "abstract": "In the era of big data, the explosive growth of Earth observation data and the rapid advancement in cloud computing technology make the global-oriented spatiotemporal data simulation possible. These dual developments also provide advantageous conditions for discrete global grid systems (DGGS). DGGS are designed to portray real-world phenomena by providing a spatiotemporal unified framework on a standard discrete geospatial data structure and theoretical support to address the challenges from big data storage, processing, and analysis to visualization and data sharing. In this paper, the trinity of big Earth observation data (BEOD), cloud computing, and DGGS is proposed, and based on this trinity theory, we explore the opportunities and challenges to handle BEOD from two aspects, namely, information technology and unified data framework. Our focus is on how cloud computing and DGGS can provide an excellent solution to enable big Earth observation data. Firstly, we describe the current status and data characteristics of Earth observation data, which indicate the arrival of the era of big data in the Earth observation domain. Subsequently, we review the cloud computing technology and DGGS framework, especially the works and contributions made in the field of BEOD, including spatial cloud computing, mainstream big data platform, DGGS standards, data models, and applications. From the aforementioned views of the general introduction, the research opportunities and challenges are enumerated and discussed, including EO data management, data fusion, and grid encoding, which are concerned with analysis models and processing performance of big Earth observation data with discrete global grid systems in the cloud environment.",

            "abstract": "Nowadays, huge amount of documents are increasingly transferred to the remote servers due to the appealing features of cloud computing. On the other hand, privacy and security of the sensitive information in untrusted cloud environment is a big concern. To alleviate such concerns, encryption of sensitive data before its transfer to the cloud has become an important risk mitigation option. Encrypted storage provides protection at the expense of a significant increase in the data management complexity. For effective management, it is critical to provide efficient selective document retrieval capability on the encrypted collection. In fact, considerable amount of searchable symmetric encryption schemes have been designed in the literature to achieve this task. However, with the emergence of big data everywhere, available approaches are insufficient to address some crucial real-world problems such as scalability. In this study, we focus on practical aspects of a secure keyword search mechanism over encrypted data. First, we propose a provably secure distributed index along with a parallelizable retrieval technique that can easily scale to big data. Second, we integrate authorization into the search scheme to limit the information leakage in multi-user setting where users are allowed to access only particular documents. Third, we offer efficient updates on the distributed secure index. In addition, we conduct extensive empirical analysis on a real dataset to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed practical techniques.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we present the QuantCloud infrastructure, designed for performing big data analytics in modern quantitative finance. Through analyzing market observations, quantitative finance (QF) utilizes mathematical models to search for subtle patterns and inefficiencies in financial markets to improve prospective profits. To discover profitable signals in anticipation of volatile trading patterns amid a global market, analytics are carried out on Exabyte-scale market metadata with a complex process in pursuit of a microsecond or even a nanosecond of data processing advantage. This objective motivates the development of innovative tools to address challenges for handling high volume, velocity, and variety investment instruments. Inspired by this need, we developed QuantCloud by employing large-scale SSD-backed datastore, various parallel processing algorithms, and portability in Cloud computing. QuantCloud bridges the gap between model computing techniques and financial data-driven research. The large volume of market data is structured in an SSD-backed datastore, and a daemon reacts to provide the Data-on-Demand services. Multiple client services process user requests in a parallel mode and query on-demand datasets from the datastore through Internet connections. We benchmark QuantCloud performance on a 40-core, 1TB-memory computer and a 5-TB SSD-backed datastore. We use NYSE TAQ data from the fourth quarter of 2014 as our market data. The results indicate data-access application latency as low as 3.6 nanoseconds per message, sustained throughput for parallel data processing as high as 74 million messages per second, and completion of 11 petabyte-level data analytics within 53 minutes. Our results demonstrate that the aggregated contributions of our infrastructure, parallel algorithms, and sophisticated implementations offer the algorithmic trading and financial engineering community new hope and numeric insights for their research and development.",

            "abstract": "The size of the databases used in today's enterprises has been growing at exponential rates day by day. Simultaneously, the need to process and analyze the large volumes of data for business decision making has also increased. In several business and scientific applications, there is a need to process terabytes of data in efficient manner on daily bases. This has contributed to the big data problem faced by the industry due to the inability of conventional database systems and software tools to manage or process the big data sets within tolerable time limits. Processing of data can include various operations depending on usage like culling, tagging, highlighting, indexing, searching, faceting, etc operations. It is not possible for single or few machines to store or process this huge amount of data in a finite time period. This paper reports the experimental work on big data problem and its optimal solution using Hadoop cluster, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for storage and using parallel processing to process large data sets using Map Reduce programming framework. We have done prototype implementation of Hadoop cluster, HDFS storage and Map Reduce framework for processing large data sets by considering prototype of big data application scenarios. The results obtained from various experiments indicate favorable results of above approach to address big data problem.",

            "abstract": "With the advent of Cloud Computing, Big Data management has become a fundamental challenge during the deployment and operation of distributed highly available and fault-tolerant storage systems such as the HBase extensible record-store. These systems can provide support for geo-replication, which comes with the issue of data consistency among distributed sites. In order to offer a best-in-class service to applications, one wants to maximise performance while minimising latency. In terms of data replication, that means incurring in as low latency as possible when moving data between distant data centres. Traditional consistency models introduce a significant problem for systems architects, which is specially important to note in cases where large amounts of data need to be replicated across wide-area networks. In such scenarios it might be suitable to use eventual consistency, and even though not always convenient, latency can be partly reduced and traded for consistency guarantees so that data-transfers do not impact performance. In contrast, this work proposes a broader range of data semantics for consistency while prioritising data at the cost of putting a minimum latency overhead on the rest of non-critical updates. Finally, we show how these semantics can help in finding an optimal data replication strategy for achieving just the required level of data consistency under low latency and a more efficient network bandwidth utilisation.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel decaying operator for Telco Big Data (TBD), coined TBD-DP (Data Postdiction). Unlike data prediction, which aims to make a statement about the future value of some tuple, our formulated data postdiction term, aims to make a statement about the past value of some tuple, which does not exist anymore as it had to be deleted to free up disk space. TBD-DP relies on existing Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to abstract TBD into compact models that can be stored and queried when necessary. Our proposed TBD-DP operator has the following two conceptual phases: (i) in an offline phase, it utilizes a LSTM-based hierarchical ML algorithm to learn a tree of models (coined TBD-DP tree) over time and space; (ii) in an online phase, it uses the TBD-DP tree to recover data within a certain accuracy. In our experimental setup, we measure the efficiency of the proposed operator using a ~10GB anonymized real telco network trace and our experimental results in Tensorflow over HDFS are extremely encouraging as they show that TBD-DP saves an order of magnitude storage space while maintaining a high accuracy on the recovered data.",

This study deals with the potential of big data on the improvement of the various supply chain processes. The aim of this paper is to elaborate which characteristic of big data (lever) has the greatest potential to mitigate the bullwhip effect. From previous research, starting points for big data applications are derived. By using an existing system dynamics model, the big data levers \u2018velocity\u2019, \u2018volume\u2019 and \u2018variety\u2019 are transferred into a simulation. Overall, positive impacts of all the big data levers are elaborated. Findings suggest that the data property \u2018velocity\u2019 relatively bears the greatest potential to enhance performance. The results of this research will help in justifying the application of big data in supply chain management. The paper contributes to the literature by operationalising big data in the control engineering analyses.",

            "abstract": "In the last years, Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data platforms are clearly converging in terms of technologies, problems and approaches. IoT workloads generate a vast amount of data that needs to be stored and processed, becoming a Big Data problem. IoT devices and sensors generate streams of data across a diversity of locations and protocols that in the end reach a central platform that is used to store and process these streams. Processing can be done in real time, with transformations and enrichment happening on-the-fly, but it can also happen after data is stored and organized in repositories. In the former case, stream processing technologies are required to operate on the data, in the latter analytics and queries are of common use. This paper presents a detailed characterization of the servIoTicy platform: a state-of-the-art infrastructure for hosting Internet of Things (IoT) workloads in the Cloud. It provides multi-tenant data stream processing capabilities, a REST API, data analytics, advanced queries and multi-protocol support in a combination of advanced data-centric technologies. The deployment of such a complex platform in the cloud requires a detailed understanding of all these components and tiers to allow for auto-scaling and dynamic provisioning capabilities. This paper aims to provide this initial characterization to be the basis for advanced cloud provisioning strategies and algorithms.",

            "abstract": "Currently, how to deeply distill potential attributes of big data has become a great challenge for structured, semi-structured and unstructured data (SSU data) with a unified model. Structured data refers to any data that resides in a fixed field within a record or file including data contained in relational databases and spreadsheets. Unstructured data refers to data from text, pictures, audio, video, and other sources that do not fit into a relational database. Semi-structured data is information that doesn't reside in a relational database but that does have some organizational properties that make it easier to analyze, such as XML, and HTML documents. In this paper, we present a literature survey and a framework, namely integrated big data (IBD), which aims at exploring the approaches for constructing a universal IBD model, including representation, storage and management, computation, and visual analysis. Firstly, we present a systematic framework to decompose big data analytics into four modules. Next, we present a detailed survey of numerous approaches for these four modules. The main contributions of this paper are summarized in two dimensions. First, we propose a novel integrated big data framework for unified big data representation, storage, computation, and visual analysis. Second, we present the possible future methods in realizing the framework by reviewing methods. Through this paper, we would like to point out a promising research direction in unified investigation and application of big data.",

            "abstract": "Recently, a great deal of interest for Big Data has risen, mainly driven from a widespread number of research problems strongly related to real-life applications and systems, such as representing, modeling, processing, querying and mining massive, distributed, large-scale repositories (mostly being of unstructured nature). Inspired by this main trend, in this paper we discuss three important aspects of Big Data research, namely OLAP over Big Data, Big Data Posting, and Privacy of Big Data. We also depict future research directions, hence implicitly defining a research agenda aiming at leading future challenges in this research field.",

            "abstract": "The success of the Hadoop MapReduce programming model has greatly propelled research in big data analytics. In recent years, there is a growing interest in the High Performance Computing (HPC) community to use Hadoop-based tools for processing scientific data. This interest is due to the facts that data movement becomes prohibitively expensive, highperformance data analytic becomes an important part of HPC, and Hadoop-based tools can perform large-scale data processing in a time and budget efficient manner. In this study, we propose PortHadoop, an enhanced Hadoop architecture that enables MapReduce applications reading data directly from HPC parallel file systems (PFS). PortHadoop saves HDFS storage space, and, more importantly, avoids the otherwise costly data copying. PortHadoop keeps all the semantics in the original Hadoop system and PFS. Therefore, Hadoop MapReduce applications can run on PortHadoop without code change except that the input file location is in PFS rather than HDFS. Our experimental results show that PortHadoop can operate effectively and efficiently with the PVFS2 and Ceph file systems.",

This model knows difficult problems related to low-level and batch nature of MR that gives rise to an abstraction layer on the top of MR. Therefore; several High-Level MapReduce Query Languages built on the top of MR provide more abstract query languages and extend the MR programming model. These High-Level MapReduce Query Languages remove the burden of MR programming away from the developers and make a soft migration of existing competences with SQL skills to Big Data. This paper investigates the very used\u2014common High-Level MapReduce Query Languages built directly on the top of MR that translate queries into executable native MR jobs. It evaluates the performance of the four presented High-Level MapReduce Query Languages: JAQL, Hive, Big SQL and Pig, with regards to their insightful perspectives and ease of programming. The baseline metrics reported are increasing input size, scale-out number of nodes and controlling number of reducers. The experimental results study the technical advantages and limitations of each High-Level MapReduce Query Languages. Finally, the paper provides a summary for developers to choose the High-Level MapReduce Query Languages which fulfill their needs and interests.",

            "title": "Evaluating the Open Source Data Containers for Handling Big Geospatial Raster Data",
            "abstract": "Big geospatial raster data pose a grand challenge to data management technologies for effective big data query and processing. To address these challenges, various big data container solutions have been developed or enhanced to facilitate data storage, retrieval, and analysis. Data containers were also developed or enhanced to handle geospatial data. For example, Rasdaman was developed to handle raster data and GeoSpark/SpatialHadoop were enhanced from Spark/Hadoop to handle vector data. However, there are few studies to systematically compare and evaluate the features and performances of these popular data containers. This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of six popular data containers (i.e., Rasdaman, SciDB, Spark, ClimateSpark, Hive, and MongoDB) for handling multi-dimensional, array-based geospatial raster datasets. Their architectures, technologies, capabilities, and performance are compared and evaluated from two perspectives: (a) system design and architecture (distributed architecture, logical data model, physical data model, and data operations); and (b) practical use experience and performance (data preprocessing, data uploading, query speed, and resource consumption). Four major conclusions are offered: (1) no data containers, except ClimateSpark, have good support for the HDF data format used in this paper, requiring time- and resource-consuming data preprocessing to load data; (2) SciDB, Rasdaman, and MongoDB handle small/mediate volumes of data query well, whereas Spark and ClimateSpark can handle large volumes of data with stable resource consumption; (3) SciDB and Rasdaman provide mature array-based data operation and analytical functions, while the others lack these functions for users; and (4) SciDB, Spark, and Hive have better support of user defined functions (UDFs) to extend the system capability.",

            "abstract": "High-quality data are the precondition for analyzing and using big data and for guaranteeing the value of the data. Currently, comprehensive analysis and research of quality standards and quality assessment methods for big data are lacking. First, this paper summarizes reviews of data quality research. Second, this paper analyzes the data characteristics of the big data environment, presents quality challenges faced by big data, and formulates a hierarchical data quality framework from the perspective of data users. This framework consists of big data quality dimensions, quality characteristics, and quality indexes. Finally, on the basis of this framework, this paper constructs a dynamic assessment process for data quality. This process has good expansibility and adaptability and can meet the needs of big data quality assessment. The research results enrich the theoretical scope of big data and lay a solid foundation for the future by establishing an assessment model and studying evaluation algorithms.",

            "abstract": "The advent of Big Data created a need for out-of-the-box horizontal scalability for data management systems. This ushered in an array of choices for Big Data management under the umbrella term NoSQL. In this paper, we provide a taxonomy and unified perspective on NoSQL systems. Using this perspective, we compare and contrast various NoSQL systems using multiple facets including system architecture, data model, query language, client API, scalability, and availability. We group current NoSQL systems into seven broad categories: Key-Value, Table-type/Column, Document, Graph, Native XML, Native Object, and Hybrid databases. We also describe application scenarios for each category to help the reader in choosing an appropriate NoSQL system for a given application. We conclude the paper by indicating future research directions.",

            "abstract": "Advances in healthcare data management and analytics have opened new horizons for healthcare providers such as cost effective treatments, ability to detect medical fraud, and diagnose diseases at an early stage. Central to these abilities is the need for fast ad-hoc query processing of large volumes of complex healthcare datasets. End users who work with healthcare databases spend enormous effort in data exploration since exploration is the first step to any subsequent predictive modeling to generate actionable insights for patients, providers and physicians. Unfortunately, unlike other domains the complexity and volumes of claims (ICD9 or 10) as well as clinical (HL7) healthcare datasets results in data exploration solutions being extremely slow and cumbersome when attempted using traditional disk resident data warehousing approaches. In this paper we describe the first ever attempt of real-time data exploration for healthcare datasets using in-memory databases. We benchmark and compare two such in-memory database systems to study responsiveness and ability to handle complexity of typical health data exploration tasks. We share our work in progress results and outline key issues that need to be addressed for forthcoming advances in this very important big data vertical.",

            "abstract": "IT is my great pleasure to present this inaugural issue of the IEEE Transactions on Big Data (IEEE TBDATA). Big Data is a new field that encompasses multiple disciplines and impacts a wide range of sectors of our society. Its rapid rise in recent years can be attributed to several technological advances. The increasing availability of sensors made data generation and collection easier and cheaper. Advances in telecommunications technologies and services facilitated the massive exchange of data among client devices, data centers and clouds. The fast reduction in data storage and processing costs gives rise to fast growth in increasing computational power. As a result, novel applications are widely found that span across diverse fields as never before. Big Data can be characterized by its extraordinary characteristics along several dimensions. The first of the dimensions is the size of data. Data sets grow in sizes partly because they are being gathered by cheaper and easier-to operate information sensing mobile devices. This is referred to as Volume by industry leaders [1]. Other dimensions are equally important, including Big Data\u2019s Variety (the data types are many and heterogeneous), Velocity (the speed is fast in which the data is generated and processed to meet the demands) and Veracity (the quality of the data being captured can vary greatly). These complexities pose a major challenge as well as new opportunity for today\u2019s information technology communities. The term Big Data goes well beyond the data itself; it is also often used to refer to a new methodology to approach our problems and solutions. As pointed out in [2], our scientific advances fall in different stages, or paradigms, as the human race moves forward. The first paradigm is known as the empirical stage, which happened when scientific discovery was mainly driven by recording empirical observations through tools such as telescopes. The second stage was when theories were introduced to summarize the observations and make predictions. Scientists such as Newton used mathematics and physical laws to build models to explain the empirical observations. The third paradigm came as a result of the arrival of digital computers, when large-scale simulations were used to mimic the dynamics of nature. With the arrival of the Big Data, we are at the beginning of the fourth paradigm of scientific discovery, when knowledge discovery is done through hypothesis testing driven by the availability of the massive digital data. In this fourth-paradigm way of scientific thinking, data becomes a first-class citizen, giving birth to the particular practice of knowledge discovery known as Data Science. Thus, Big Data is situated at the cross roads of many disciplines, and this new IEEE Transactions on Big Data aspires to lead this technological revolution to the next level. The journal will serve as a forum for the Big Data community to exchange ideas and report its successes. In particular, the journal will cover the following broad areas:",

In part, this is due to the lack of clarity in the RE literature and practices on how to treat Big Data and the \u201cV\u201d characteristics in the development of Big Data applications. Traditionally, researchers in the RE field have created domain models that help in understanding the context of the problem, and in supporting communication and analysis in a project. Analogously, for the emerging field of software applications involving Big Data, we propose an empirically derived RE artefact model. It has been validated for qualities such as: accuracy, completeness, usefulness, and generalisability by ten practitioners from Big Data software development projects in industry. The validation results indicate that the model captures the key RE elements and relationships involved in the development of Big Data software applications. The resultant artefact model is anticipated to help in such activities as: requirements elicitation and specification; definition of specific RE processes; customising and creating a common vision in Big Data RE projects; and creating traceability tools linking the artefacts.",

            "abstract": "Big data is currently one of the most critical emerging technologies. Big Data are used as a concept that refers to the inability of traditional data architectures to efficiently handle the new data sets. The 4V\u2019s of big data \u2013 volume, velocity, variety and veracity makes the data management and analytics challenging for the traditional data warehouses. It is important to think of big data and analytics together. Big data is the term used to describe the recent explosion of different types of data from disparate sources. Analytics is about examining data to derive interesting and relevant trends and patterns, which can be used to inform decisions, optimize processes, and even drive new business models. Cloud computing seems to be a perfect vehicle for hosting big data workloads. However, working on big data in the cloud brings its own challenge of reconciling two contradictory design principles. Cloud computing is based on the concepts of consolidation and resource pooling, but big data systems (such as Hadoop) are built on the shared nothing principle, where each node is independent and selfsufficient. The integrating big data with cloud computing technologies, businesses and education institutes can have a better direction to the future. The capability to store large amounts of data in different forms and process it all at very large speeds will result in data that can guide businesses and education institutes in developing fast. Nevertheless, there is a large concern regarding privacy and security issues when moving to the cloud which is the main causes as to why businesses and educational institutes will not move to the cloud. This paper introduces the characteristics, trends and challenges of big data. In addition to that, it investigates the benefits and the risks that may rise out of the integration between big data and cloud computing.",

In this \u201cRound Two\u201d Digging Into Data Challenge award, we explored uses and approaches for large-scale data analysis and processing for the Humanities and Social Sciences through the integration of several infrastructure frameworks: Cheshire, iRODS, and Amazon Web Services (EC2 computing and S3 storage). Our \u201cbig data\u201d consisted of the entire texts collection of the Internet Archive (approximately 3.6 million volumes) and the entire JSTOR database. We performed surface-level natural language processing on this data to identify noun phrases and further refinements to identify personal, corporate, and geographic names. We then used resources including library and archival authority records to identify variants and merge names. The goal is to create an integrated index of persons, places, and organizations referenced in our collections.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to analyze the inadequacies of current business education in the tackling of the educational challenges inherent to the advent of a data-driven business world. It presents an analysis of the implications of digitization and more specifically big data analytics (BDA) and data science (DS) on organizations with a special emphasis on decision-making processes and the function of managers. It argues that business schools and other educational institutions have well responded to the need to train future data scientists but have rather disregarded the question of effectively preparing future managers for the new data-driven business era.,The approach involves analysis and review of the literature.,The development of analytics skills shall not pertain to data scientists only, it must rather become an organizational cultural component shared among all employees and more specifically among decision makers: managers. In the data-driven business era, managers turn into manager-scientists who shall possess skills at the crossroad of data management, analytical/modeling techniques and tools, and business. However, the multidisciplinary nature of big data analytics and data science (BDADS) seems to collide with the dominant \u201cfunctional silo design\u201d that characterizes business schools. The scope and breadth of the radical digitally enabled change, the author are facing, may necessitate a global questioning about the nature and structure of business education.,For the sake of transparency and clarity, academia and the industry must join forces to standardize the meaning of the terms surrounding big data. BDA/DS training programs, courses, and curricula shall be organized in such a way that students shall interact with an array of specialists providing them a broad enough picture of the big data landscape. The multidisciplinary nature of analytics and DS necessitates to revisit pedagogical models by developing experiential learning and implementing a spiral-shaped pedagogical approach. The attention of scholars is needed as there exists an array of unexplored research territories. This investigation will help bridge the gap between education and the industry.,The findings will help practitioners understand the educational challenges triggered by the advent of the data-driven business era. The implications will also help develop effective trainings and pedagogical strategies that are better suited to prepare future professionals for the new data-driven business world.,By demonstrating how the advent of a data-driven business era is impacting the function and role of managers, the paper initiates a debate revolving around the question about how business schools and higher education shall evolve to better tackle the educational challenges associated with BDADS training. Elements of response and recommendations are then provided.",

With multiple RDBMS-based systems, such a large volume of HL7 messages still cannot be real-time or near-real-time stored, analyzed, and retrieved for enterprise-level clinic and nonclinic usage. To determine if Big Data technology coupled with ElasticSearch technology can satisfy MC daily healthcare needs for HL7 message processing, a BigData platform was developed to contain two identical Hadoop clusters (TDH1.3.2 version)\u2014each containing an ElasticSearch cluster and instances of a storm topology\u2014MayoTopology for processing HL7 messages on MC ESB queues into an ElasticSearch index and the HDFS. The implemented BigData platform can process 62 \u00b1 4 million HL7 messages per day while the ElasticSearch index can provide ultrafast free-text searching at a speed level of 0.2-s per query on an index containing a dataset of 25 million HL7-derived-JSON-documents. The results suggest that the implemented BigData platform exceeds MC enterprise-level patient-care needs.",

            "abstract": "Purpose \n \n \n \n \nThe purpose of this paper is to provide a conceptual model for the transformation of big data sets into actionable knowledge. The model introduces a framework for converting data to actionable knowledge and mitigating potential risk to the organization. A case utilizing a dashboard provides a practical application for analysis of big data. \n \n \n \n \nDesign/methodology/approach \n \n \n \n \nThe model can be used both by scholars and practitioners in business process management. This paper builds and extends theories in the discipline, specifically related to taking action using big data analytics with tools such as dashboards. \n \n \n \n \nFindings \n \n \n \n \nThe authors\u2019 model made use of industry experience and network resources to gain valuable insights into effective business process management related to big data analytics. Cases have been provided to highlight the use of dashboards as a visual tool within the conceptual framework. \n \n \n \n \nPractical implications \n \n \n \n \nThe literature review cites articles that have used big data analytics in practice. The transitions required to reach the actionable knowledge state and dashboard visualization tools can all be deployed by practitioners. A specific case example from ESP International is provided to illustrate the applicability of the model. \n \n \n \n \nSocial implications \n \n \n \n \nInformation assurance, security, and the risk of large-scale data breaches are a contemporary problem in society today. These topics have been considered and addressed within the model framework. \n \n \n \n \nOriginality/value \n \n \n \n \nThe paper presents a unique and novel approach for parsing data into actionable knowledge items, identification of viruses, an application of visual dashboards for identification of problems, and a formal discussion of risk inherent with big data.",

            "abstract": "Developments in digitisation, software and processing power and the accompanying data explosion create significant alterations, dilemmas and possibilities for enterprises and their finance function. The article discusses a model for understanding data, information and knowledge relationships. We apply the model to examine developments in strategy, organisational and cost structures, digitisation, business analytics, outsourcing, offshoring and cloud computing. We argue that organisations need to be sensitised to different types of knowledge, the challenges in creating and applying that knowledge, and be more circumspect about what can be achieved through advances in information-based technologies and software. We point to both the potential of and the complexities presented by Big Data in relation to the finance function generally and to management accounting information provision specifically. We suggest that \u2018Big Data\u2019 and data analysis techniques enable executives to act on structured and unstructured information but such action must recognise that the traditionally presumed sequential and linear links among corporate strategy, firm structure and information systems design are no longer in play. Additionally, cost structure changes are affected by developments in how data, information and knowledge can be utilised. We discuss the outsourcing and offshoring of work and their data, information and knowledge ramifications as well as those related to cloud computing. We conclude that the possibilities for the digitally enabled business create a range of \u2018information literacy\u2019 challenges as well as new possibilities for accounting information providers.",

            "abstract": "Recent years, the scale of spatial data is developing more and more huge and its storage has encountered a lot of problems. Traditional DBMS can efficiently handle some big spatial data. However, popular open source relational database systems are overwhelmed by the high insertion rates, querying requirements and terabytes of data that these systems can handle. On the other hand, key-value storage can effectively support large scale operations. To resolve the problems of big vector spatial data's storage and query, we bring forward HBase Spatial, a scalable spatial dada storage based on HBase. At first, we analyze the distributed storage model of HBase. Then, we design a distributed storage and index model. Finally, the advantages of our storage model and index algorithm are proven by experiments with both big sample sets and typical benchmarks on cluster compared with MongoDB and Mysql, which shows that our model can effectively enhance the query speed of big spatial data and provide a good solution for storage.",

            "abstract": "Purpose \n \n \n \n \nThe purpose of this paper is to introduce and define Cognitive Big Data as a concept. Furthermore, it investigates what is really \u201cnew\u201d in Big Data, as it seems to be a hyped-up concept that has emerged during recent years. The purpose is also to broaden the discussion around Big Data far beyond the common 4V (velocity, volume, veracity and variety) model. \n \n \n \n \nDesign/methodology/approach \n \n \n \n \nThe authors established an expert think tank to discuss the notion of Big Data, identify new characteristics and re-think what really is new in the idea of Big Data, by analyzing over 60 literature resources. They identified typical baseline scenarios (traffic, business processes, retail, health and social media) as a starting point from which they explored the notion of Big Data from different perspectives. \n \n \n \n \nFindings \n \n \n \n \nThey concluded that the idea of Big Data is simply not new and recognized the need to re-think a new approach toward Big Data. The authors also introduced a five-Trait Framework for \u201cCognitive Big Data\u201d, socio-technical system, data space, data richness, knowledge management (KM)/decision-making and visualization/sensory presentation. \n \n \n \n \nResearch limitations/implications \n \n \n \n \nThe viewpoint is centered on cognitive processes as KM process. \n \n \n \n \nPractical implications \n \n \n \n \nData need to be made available in an understandable form for the right application context and in the right portion size that it can be turned into knowledge and eventually wisdom. The authors need to know about data that can be ignored, data that they are not aware of (dark data) and data that can be fully utilized for analysis (light data). In the foreground is the extension of human mental capabilities and data understandability. \n \n \n \n \nSocial implications \n \n \n \n \nCognitive Big Data implies a socio-technological knowledge system. \n \n \n \n \nOriginality/value \n \n \n \n \nIntroduction of cognitive Big Data as concept and framework.",

In this work, we are focusing on stream processing and reasoning using the graph-based RDF data model. We are aiming to explore the ability of modern distributed computing frameworks to process highly expressive knowledge inference queries over Big Data streams. To do so, we consider queries expressed as a positive fragment of a temporal logic framework based on Answer Set Programming and propose solutions to process such queries, based on the two main execution models adopted by major parallel and distributed execution frameworks: Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) and Recordat-A-Time (RAT). We implement our solution named BigSR and conduct a series of experiments with 15 queries from 4 different datasets. Our experiments show that BigSR achieves high throughput beyond million-triples per second using a rather small cluster of machines.",

            "abstract": "Big data conventionally coins large volume of data that continuously increases in a real-time basis and difficult to store, retrieve, and process in traditional database techniques. But it is necessary to know that big data is unstructured and does not follow the conventional storage retrieval methods. The challenges are to store in a cloud, process, and develop meaningful form so that it is useful to the businesses, government, and customers. This paper discusses the current challenges to store, retrieve, process, and implement security requirements, and possible solutions. We further provide the security model in a dynamic cloud environment to store, process and retrieve the data.",

Howerver, several issues would occur when we reuse these massive traffic data for history data mining applying on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing apporaches, such as massive storage, high performance processing, open interface. \"Big Data\" system usually includes data sets with sizes beyond the ability of commonly-used software tools to capture, manage, and process the data within a tolerable elapsed time. With this difficulty and the advantage of \"Big Data\", we schemed RTIC-C system to handle sensemaking over large quantities of traffic data based on cloud computing technique. RTIC-C designs a distributed data management service to support large scale of data storage, a parallel distributed computing framework for diverse kinds of mining applications based on Map-Reduce mechanism, a restful Web services interface to support third-party mining applications. Experiments on a massive traffic data sets showed that RTIC-C achieves considerable performance comparing with traditional traffic data mining applications.",

            "abstract": "Summary Objectives: To review technical and methodological challenges for big data research in biomedicine and health. Methods: We discuss sources of big datasets, survey infrastructures for big data storage and big data processing, and describe the main challenges that arise when analyzing big data. Results: The life and biomedical sciences are massively contributing to the big data revolution through secondary use of data that were collected during routine care and through new data sources such as social media. Efficient processing of big datasets is typically achieved by distributing computation over a cluster of computers. Data analysts should be aware of pitfalls related to big data such as bias in routine care data and the risk of false-positive findings in high-dimensional datasets. Conclusions: The major challenge for the near future is to transform analytical methods that are used in the biomedical and health domain, to fit the distributed storage and processing model that is required to handle big data, while ensuring confidentiality of the data being analyzed.",

            "abstract": "Recently, the cloud computing platform is getting more and more attentions as a new trend of data management. Currently there are several cloud computing products that can provide various services. However, most cloud platforms are not designed for structured data management. So they rarely support SQL queries directly. Even though some platforms support SQL queries, their bottoms are traditional relational database, therefore, the cost for executing a subquery in RDBS may influence the overall query performance. How to improve query efficiency in cloud data management system, especially query on structured data has become a more and more important problem. To address the issue, an efficient algorithm about query processing on structured data is proposed. Our approach is inspired by the idea of MapReduce, in which a job is divided into several tasks. Based on the distributed storage of one table, this algorithm divides a user query into different subqueries, at the same time, with replicas in cloud, a subquery is mapped to k+1 subqueries. Every subquery has to wait in the queue of the slave where the query data store. To balance the load, our algorithm also takes two scheduling strategies to dispatch the subquery. Besides, in order to reduce the client's long waiting time, we adopt the pipeline strategy to process result returning. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our algorithm with kinds of experiments. Our approach is quite general and independent from the underlying infrastructure and can be easily carried over for implementation on various cloud computing platforms.",

            "abstract": "As data sets grow and conventional processor performance scaling slows, data analytics move towards heterogeneous architectures that incorporate hardware accelerators (notably GPUs) to continue scaling performance. However, existing GPU-based databases fail to deal with big data applications efficiently: their execution model suffers from scalability limitations on GPUs whose memory capacity is limited; existing systems fail to consider the discrepancy between fast GPUs and slow storage, which can counteract the benefit of GPU accelerators. \n \nIn this paper, we propose HippogriffDB, an efficient, scalable GPU-accelerated OLAP system. It tackles the bandwidth discrepancy using compression and an optimized data transfer path. HippogriffDB stores tables in a compressed format and uses the GPU for decompression, trading GPU cycles for the improved I/O bandwidth. To improve the data transfer efficiency, HippogriffDB introduces a peer-to-peer, multi-threaded data transfer mechanism, directly transferring data from the SSD to the GPU. HippogriffDB adopts a query-over-block execution model that provides scalability using a stream-based approach. The model improves kernel efficiency with the operator fusion and double buffering mechanism. \n \nWe have implemented HippogriffDB using an NVMe SSD, which talks directly to a commercial GPU. Results on two popular benchmarks demonstrate its scalability and efficiency. HippogriffDB outperforms existing GPU-based databases (YDB) and in-memory data analytics (MonetDB) by 1-2 orders of magnitude.",

            "abstract": "Big-data systems are increasingly used in many disciplines for important tasks such as knowledge discovery and decision making by processing large volumes of data. Big-data systems rely on hard-disk drive (HDD) based storage to provide the necessary capacity. However, as big-data applications grow rapidly more diverse and demanding, HDD storage becomes insufficient to satisfy their performance requirements. Emerging solid-state drives (SSDs) promise great IO performance that can be exploited by big-data applications, but they still face serious limitations in capacity, cost, and endurance and therefore must be strategically incorporated into big-data systems. This paper presents BigCache, an SSD-based distributed caching layer for big-data systems. It is designed to be seamlessly integrated with existing big-data systems and transparently accelerate IOs for diverse big-data applications. The management of the distributed SSD caches in BigCache is coordinated with the job management of big-data systems in order to support cache-locality-driven job scheduling. BigCache is prototyped in Hadoop to provide caching upon HDFS for MapReduce applications. It is evaluated using typical MapReduce applications, and the results show that BigCache reduces the runtime of WordCount by 38% and the runtime of TeraSort by 52%. The results also show that BigCache is able to achieve significant speedup by caching only partial input for the benchmarks, owing to its ability to cache partial input and its replacement policy that recognizes application access patterns.",

Increased data volumes and heightened interest in processing complex analytical queries have prompted Pivotal to build a new query optimizer. In this paper we present the architecture of Orca, the new query optimizer for all Pivotal data management products, including Pivotal Greenplum Database and Pivotal HAWQ. Orca is a comprehensive development uniting state-of-the-art query optimization technology with own original research resulting in a modular and portable optimizer architecture. In addition to describing the overall architecture, we highlight several unique features and present performance comparisons against other systems.",

            "abstract": "During the past decade, various GPS-equipped devices have generated a tremendous amount of data with time and location information, which we refer to as big spatio-temporal data. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of CloST, a scalable big spatio-temporal data storage system to support data analytics using Hadoop. The main objective of CloST is to avoid scan the whole dataset when a spatio-temporal range is given. To this end, we propose a novel data model which has special treatments on three core attributes including an object id, a location and a time. Based on this data model, CloST hierarchically partitions data using all core attributes which enables efficient parallel processing of spatio-temporal range scans. According to the data characteristics, we devise a compact storage structure which reduces the storage size by an order of magnitude. In addition, we proposes scalable bulk loading algorithms capable of incrementally adding new data into the system. We conduct our experiments using a very large GPS log dataset and the results show that CloST has fast data loading speed, desirable scalability in query processing, as well as high data compression ratio.",

            "abstract": "Cloud computing has become popular and grown to be a dominant computing model as a result of several advantages it has compared to other computing models. In addition to having desirable properties such as agility and flexibility, cloud computing helps users to save a significant amount of expense that is related to infrastructure investment, management and maintenance. Many types of services have been hosted in different stacks of the cloud from low-level stacks such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) to high-level stacks such as Software as a Service (SaaS) and Data as a Service (DaaS). Given that anything can be developed and deployed as a service in the cloud and an increasing demand for Big Data processing, a new type of cloud computing service, Big Data as a Service (BDaaS), has been introduced recently. In this paper, we will present a high-level design of a general framework for BDaaS. But prior to that, we will discuss properties and challenges of building such framework.",

            "abstract": "There is a tremendous interest in big data by academia, industry and a large user base. Several commercial and open source providers unleashed a variety of products to support big data storage and processing. As these products mature, there is a need to evaluate and compare the performance of these systems.\n In this paper, we present BigBench, an end-to-end big data benchmark proposal. The underlying business model of BigBench is a product retailer. The proposal covers a data model and synthetic data generator that addresses the variety, velocity and volume aspects of big data systems containing structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. The structured part of the BigBench data model is adopted from the TPC-DS benchmark, which is enriched with semi-structured and unstructured data components. The semi-structured part captures registered and guest user clicks on the retailer's website. The unstructured data captures product reviews submitted online. The data generator designed for BigBench provides scalable volumes of raw data based on a scale factor. The BigBench workload is designed around a set of queries against the data model. From a business prospective, the queries cover the different categories of big data analytics proposed by McKinsey. From a technical prospective, the queries are designed to span three different dimensions based on data sources, query processing types and analytic techniques.\n We illustrate the feasibility of BigBench by implementing it on the Teradata Aster Database. The test includes generating and loading a 200 Gigabyte BigBench data set and testing the workload by executing the BigBench queries (written using Teradata Aster SQL-MR) and reporting their response times.",

            "abstract": "Ability to track provenance is a key feature of scientific workflows to support data lineage and reproducibility. The challenges that are introduced by the volume, variety and velocity of Big Data, also pose related challenges for provenance and quality of Big Data, defined as veracity. The increasing size and variety of distributed Big Data provenance information bring new technical challenges and opportunities throughout the provenance lifecycle including recording, querying, sharing and utilization. This paper discusses the challenges and opportunities of Big Data provenance related to the veracity of the datasets themselves and the provenance of the analytical processes that analyze these datasets. It also explains our current efforts towards tracking and utilizing Big Data provenance using workflows as a programming model to analyze Big Data.",

            "abstract": "RFID technology can be applied to a broad range of areas. In particular, RFID is very useful in the area of business, such as supply chain management. However, the amount of RFID data in such an environment is huge. Therefore, much time is needed to extract valuable information from RFID data for supply chain management. In this paper, we present an efficient method to process a massive amount of RFID data for supply chain management. We first define query templates to analyze the supply chain. We then propose an effective path encoding scheme that encodes the flows of products. However, if the flows are long, the numbers in the path encoding scheme that correspond to the flows will be very large. We solve this by providing a method that divides flows. To retrieve the time information for products efficiently, we utilize a numbering scheme for the XML area. Based on the path encoding scheme and the numbering scheme, we devise a storage scheme that can process tracking queries and path oriented queries efficiently on an RDBMS. Finally, we propose a method that translates the queries to SQL queries. Experimental results show that our approach can process the queries efficiently.",

Recent advances in computational pipelines, multiphysics solvers, artificial intelligence, big data cybernetics, data processing and management tools bring the promise of digital twins and their impact on society closer to reality. Digital twinning is now an important and emerging trend in many applications. Also referred to as a computational megamodel, device shadow, mirrored system, avatar or a synchronized virtual prototype, there can be no doubt that a digital twin plays a transformative role not only in how we design and operate cyber-physical intelligent systems, but also in how we advance the modularity of multi-disciplinary systems to tackle fundamental barriers not addressed by the current, evolutionary modeling practices. In this work, we review the recent status of methodologies and techniques related to the construction of digital twins mostly from a modeling perspective. Our aim is to provide a detailed coverage of the current challenges and enabling technologies along with recommendations and reflections for various stakeholders.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT There has been a resurgence of interest in time geography studies due to emerging spatiotemporal big data in urban environments. However, the rapid increase in the volume, diversity, and intensity of spatiotemporal data poses a significant challenge with respect to the representation and computation of time geographic entities and relations in road networks. To address this challenge, a spatiotemporal data model is proposed in this article. The proposed spatiotemporal data model is based on a compressed linear reference (CLR) technique to transform network time geographic entities in three-dimensional (3D) (x, y, t) space to two-dimensional (2D) CLR space. Using the proposed spatiotemporal data model, network time geographic entities can be stored and managed in classical spatial databases. Efficient spatial operations and index structures can be directly utilized to implement spatiotemporal operations and queries for network time geographic entities in CLR space. To validate the proposed spatiotemporal data model, a prototype system is developed using existing 2D GIS techniques. A case study is performed using large-scale datasets of space-time paths and prisms. The case study indicates that the proposed spatiotemporal data model is effective and efficient for storing, managing, and querying large-scale datasets of network time geographic entities.",

            "abstract": "The user is a basic component in the whole information management process and for this reason s/he has to be taken into account in the design and implementation of frameworks and systems for information retrieval. For this reason, the problem of defining efficient techniques for knowledge representation in a user\u2019s prospective is becoming a challenging topic in both academic and industrial community. Moreover, the large amount of available data induces several problems from different points of view and it is stressed in the bigdata vision. In this latter some approaches related to the semantic web could be used to improve the data models which underlie the implementation of user-based information retrieval applications. In this paper we propose the use of a semantic approach to design the structure of a multimedia BigData. In addition, the recognition of multimodal features to represent concepts and its attributes together with linguistic properties to relate them are an effective way to bridge the gap between the target semantic classes and the available low-level multimedia descriptors. Information about users (i.e. position) is also used to recognize his/her behaviour and improve the quality of the information retrieval process. Our framework has been implemented using a NoSQL graphdb populated from very large knowledge sources and mobile technologies. Extended experiments are presented to show the effectiveness of our approach.",

            "abstract": "In the era of digital economies, data can be considered as the new commodity, fueling the next-generation software services and applications. Increasing amounts of data, generated on a daily basis by various domains, such as social networks, stock exchanges, the Internet of Things, and cyber-physical systems, are soon expected to exceed the yottabyte1 frontier. To process this overwhelming amount, Big Data solutions are being developed to enable a new generation of data-centric/data-intensive applications (DIAs) and services. However, many of such applications currently fail to meet the increasingly demanding data management requirements. In particular, proper techniques and tools to support architects and developers in DIA design are required to cope with these pressing Big Data challenges. This paper makes an initial step in this direction, aiming at reducing the gap between the architects and DIAs they have to develop. The proposed approach extends the conventional Big Data process workflow with a way of capturing and modeling the \u2018three Vs\u2019 of Big Data (i.e. volume, velocity, and variety) to provide useful insights on the overall process, knowing the behavior of its individual components. Starting from the V-attributes of the Big Data process components, the proposed framework provides an estimation of its V-metrics by evaluating a performance model generated from the process. To demonstrate the feasibility and the effectiveness of the approach, a case study on a computer vision DIA is reported.",

            "abstract": "As data continues to be produced in ever increasing quantities, and technologies such as high performance computing continue to be enhanced, the number of big data projects using advanced neural network machine learning, often referred to as deep learning, continues to increase. Unfortunately, while much has been written on the use of deep learning algorithms in terms of generating insightful analysis, much less has been written about the project management process methodologies that could enable teams to more effectively and efficiently \"do\" big data deep learning projects. Specifically, the rapid growth in the use of deep learning techniques might introduce new challenges with respect to how to execute a big data deep learning project, due to how deep learning models can learn features automatically. For example, feature engineering and model evaluation phases of big data projects might grow in importance, while other areas, such as model selection, might decrease in importance. Hence, this paper discusses the key research questions relating the potential impact of the use of deep learning on how teams should execute big data projects.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT The term 'big data' has gained huge popularity in recent years among IT professionals and academicians. Big data describes the massive amount of data that can be processed and analyzed using technology to gain business values that will help organizations to achieve competitive advantages. The current paper aims to develop a holistic model that includes the factors that would affect the success or failure of the implementation of big data in organizations. Furthermore, this research examines the opportunities that organizations would attain from implementing big data, as well as the challenges that could hinder this implementation. The proposed model provides IT managers and decision makers the important factors that they need to consider when deciding to implement big data in order to ensure that it achieves the competitive advantage. KEYWORDS: Big Data, opportunities, challenges, implementation INTRODUCTION The interest of big data has increased because of the significant amount of data generated every day. Data is getting bigger because it is continuing to be generated from more devices and more sources such as personal computers, mobile phones, government records, healthcare records, social media, street sensors, climate sensors, airport terminals, hypermarkets' points of sales, etc. These sources generate a massive amount of data and it will continue to generate more and more data as time passes since people are getting more dependent on technology. As anticipated by Cisco Visual Networking Index (VNI) report (2015), mobile data traffic is expected to grow to 24.3 Exabytes per month by 2019 because of increased usage on smartphones. This is nearly a tenfold increase over 2014. A study by Intel also showed that data has increased enormously in the last decade. It showed that humankind has generated five Exabytes until 2003. From 2003 to 2013, data has increased to reach 2.7 Zettabytes (i.e. 500x more data). Data will continue to increase to three times bigger than that by 2015. In the same context, Das et al. (2013) pointed to the rapid growth of global data. He mentioned that it took from the down of time to 2003 to create five Exabytes of information whereas now the same volume of data is created in just two days. This will continue to reach eight Zettabytes by 2015 (i.e. that is the equivalent of 18 million Libraries of Congress). Although data is increasing enormously, a very small fraction of this data has been exploited; the rest is not tapped yet. According to IBM and Intel, 90% of data is unstructured and is not used. Data can be classified into structured and unstructured data. Structured data refers to data that can be organized and stored in relational databases so it can be easily used and searched efficiently. Unstructured data refers to data, which does not have a pre-defined data model, or it is not organized in a per-defined manner such as videos, photos, images, emails, text documents and blogs. Searching and analyzing of unstructured data is more difficult than for structured data. Das et al. (2013) also argued that unstructured data would account for 90% of data in the next decade where analyzing this massive amount of data would expose new improvements in business that were impossible to determine previously. Indeed, the interest of big data has increased because it is supposed to have a significant impact on the organizations and this would be achieved by analyzing the unstructured data. According to a survey conducted by IDG Enterprise (2014) amongst more than 750 IT decision-makers in 2013, the interest in big data continues to rise, as nearly half of the respondents (50%) are implementing or planning to implement big data projects within their organizations. BIG DATA DEFINITION Although the term has gained huge popularity in recent years, it is still poorly defined and there is huge ambiguity regarding its exact meaning (Hartmann et al. \u2026",

            "abstract": "In last few years, the volume of the data has grown manyfold. The data storages have been inundated by various disparate potential data outlets, leading by social media such as Facebook, Twitter, etc. The existing data models are largely unable to illuminate the full potential of Big Data; the information that may serve as the key solution to several complex problems is left unexplored. The existing computation capacity falls short for the increasingly expanded storage capacity. The fast-paced volume expansion of the unorganized data entails a complete paradigm shift in new age data computation and witnesses the evolution of new capable data engineering techniques such as capture, curation, visualization, analyses, etc. In this paper, we provide the first level classification for modern Big Data models. Some of the leading representatives of each classification that claim to best process the Big Data in reliable and efficient way are also discussed. Also, the classification is further strengthened by the intra-class and inter-class comparisons and discussions of the undertaken Big Data models.",

            "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become an important paradigm for domain scientists to formalize and structure complex data-intensive scientific processes. The ever-increasing volumes of scientific data motivate researchers to extend scientific workflow management systems (SWFMSs) to utilize the power of Cloud computing to perform big data analyses. Unlike workflows run in traditional on-premise environments such as stand-alone workstations or grids, Cloud workflows rely on dynamically provisioned computing, storage and network resources that are terminated when no longer used. This dynamic and volatile nature of cloud resources as well as other cloud-specific factors introduce a new set of challenges for \"Cloud-enabled\" SWFMSs. Although few SWFMSs have been integrated with Cloud infrastructures that provide some experience for future research and development, a comprehensive study from an architectural perspective is still missing. To this end, we conduct a hands-on study by running a big data workflow in Amazon EC2, FutureGrid Eucalyptus and OpenStack clouds. From this experience we 1) identify the key challenges for running big data workflows in the cloud, 2) propose a generic implementation-independent system architecture that addresses these challenges, 3) develop a cloud-enabled SWFMS called DATAVIEW that delivers a specific implementation of the proposed architecture. Finally, to validate our proposed architecture we conduct a case study in which we design and run a big data workflow towards addressing EB-scale big data analysis problem in the automotive industry domain.",

            "abstract": "A huge amount of data is constantly being produced in the world. Data coming from the IoT, from scientific simulations, or from any other field of the eScience, are accumulated over historical data sets and set up the seed for future Big Data processing, with the final goal to generate added value and discover knowledge. In such computing processes, data are the main resource, however, organizing and managing data during their entire life cycle becomes a complex research topic. As part of this, Data LifeCycle (DLC) models have been proposed to efficiently organize large and complex data sets, from creation to consumption, in any field, and any scale, for an effective data usage and big data exploitation. 2. Several DLC frameworks can be found in the literature, each one defined for specific environments and scenarios. However, we realized that there is no global and comprehensive DLC model to be easily adapted to different scientific areas. For this reason, in this paper we describe the Comprehensive Scenario Agnostic Data LifeCycle (COSA-DLC) model, a DLC model which: i) is proved to be comprehensive as it addresses the 6Vs challenges (namely Value, Volume, Variety, Velocity, Variability and Veracity, and ii), it can be easily adapted to any particular scenario and, therefore, fit the requirements of a specific scientific field. In this paper we also include two use cases to illustrate the ease of the adaptation in different scenarios. We conclude that the comprehensive scenario agnostic DLC model provides several advantages, such as facilitating global data management, organization and integration, easing the adaptation to any kind of scenario, guaranteeing good data quality levels and, therefore, saving design time and efforts for the scientific and industrial communities.",
